The document you're referring to is known as the "Prophecy of the Popes" or "Prophecy of St. Malachy." Here are the key points about this prophecy:

## Origin and Discovery

The prophecy is attributed to Saint Malachy, an Irish archbishop who lived in the 12th century (1094-1148). According to legend, Malachy experienced a vision in 1139 while visiting Rome, in which he foresaw all future popes[1][2]. 

The document remained unknown in the Vatican Archives for about 440 years after Malachy's time. It was rediscovered and published by Benedictine monk Arnold de Wyon in 1590[1].

## Content and Structure 

The prophecy consists of 112 short, cryptic Latin phrases, each supposedly describing a pope. These descriptions culminate with the 112th pope, referred to as "Petrus Romanus" or "Peter the Roman"[1][2].

## The Final Pope

According to the prophecy, the last pope (Peter the Roman) would "feed his flock amid many tribulations, after which the City of the Seven Hills shall be utterly destroyed, and the awful Judge will judge the people." This is interpreted to mean that this pope will see Rome destroyed and witness the Last Judgment[1][4].

## Controversy and Skepticism

Most scholars believe the document is a 16th-century forgery, likely created around 1590. They point out that the predictions become much more vague after 1590, suggesting retroactive "predictions" for earlier popes[1][4].

## Current Relevance

Pope Francis is considered by some to be the last or second-to-last pope on the list, depending on interpretation. This has led to renewed interest in the prophecy among some Catholics[2][4].

It's important to note that the Catholic Church does not officially recognize or endorse this prophecy. While it has captured popular imagination over the centuries, it remains a controversial and disputed document in religious and historical circles.
