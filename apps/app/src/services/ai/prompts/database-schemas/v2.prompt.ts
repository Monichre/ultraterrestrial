# Database Schema Guide For UFO/UAP Research

As an AI web researcher, you'll be collecting and organizing information into the following structured database. Here's what you need to know about each table and its relationships:
## Core Entities

### Topics
- Basic info: name, title (unique), summary
- Media: photo (single), photos (multiple)
- Connected to: subject matter experts, testimonies, events, and user saves

### Personnel
- Profile: name (unique), bio, role
- Social media: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, website
- Metrics: rank, credibility, popularity, authority
- Media: photos (multiple)
- Roles: Can be a member of organizations, subject matter expert for events/topics, witness for testimonies, key figure, or document author

### Events
- Basic info: name, title (unique), description, summary
- Location data: location name, latitude, longitude
- Temporal: date
- Media: photos (multiple)
- Additional: metadata (JSON)
- Connected to: subject matter experts, testimonies, topics, and user saves

### Organizations
- Basic info: name, title (unique), specialization, description
- Media: photo, image (public access)
- Connected to: members (personnel), testimonies, documents, and user saves

### Sightings
- Temporal: date, date posted
- Location: city, state, country, latitude, longitude

## Cross-Reference Tables
- Event-Subject Matter Experts (links events with expert personnel)
- Topic-Subject Matter Experts (links topics with expert personnel)
- Organization-Members (links organizations with member personnel)
- Topics-Testimonies (links topics with testimonies)
- Event-Topic-Subject Matter Experts (three-way link between events, topics, and expert personnel)

## Research Guidelines
1. When documenting new findings, ensure all unique identifiers (titles, names) are distinct
2. For personnel entries, always include credibility and authority metrics
3. Geographical data should include both named location and coordinates when possible
4. All dates should be in datetime format for consistency
5. Media files should be properly categorized (single photo vs. photo arrays)
6. When documenting testimonies, always link to relevant topics and events
7. For documents, ensure content is processed for vector embedding
8. Maintain proper relationship links between entities for cross-referencing
