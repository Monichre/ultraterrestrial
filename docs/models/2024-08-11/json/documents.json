The current SETI paradigm and its \"assumption of mediocrity\" place restrictions on forms of non-human intelligence that may be researched. A similar bias exists in the ufologists' often-stated hypothesis that UAP, if real, must represent space visitors. Observing that both models are biased by anthropomorph ism, the authors attempt to clarify the issues surrounding \"high strangeness\" observations by distinguishing six layers of information that can be derived from UAP events, namely (1) physical manifestations, (2) anti-physical effects, (3) psychological factors, (4) physiological factors, (5) psychic effects and (6) cultural effects. In a further step they propose a framework for scientific analysis of unidentified aerial phenomena that takes into account the incommensurability problem.","embedding":null,"file":[{"enablePublicUrl":false,"id":"i1ru7pja0t1fj6766ducrv79is","mediaType":"application/pdf","name":"Incommensurability_Orthodoxy_and_the_Physics_of_Hi.pdf","signedUrlTimeout":600,"size":161216,"storageKey":"43g81i6igd76ff1mek813kj75o","uploadKey":"cp2epkl4mibkl2ugm0sg","uploadUrlTimeout":86400,"version":0}],"id":"rec_cp2epkl4mibkl2ugm0s0","title":" Incommensurability, Orthodoxy and the Physics of High Strangeness: A 6-layer Model for Anomalous Phenomena","xata":{"createdAt":"2024-05-15 17:11:46.630739+00","updatedAt":"2024-05-15 17:11:46.630739+00","version":0}}],"total":0}
