These cases involve newborn or premature calves that were killed and mutilated in ways that don’t conform to typical animal mutilation patterns. The report aims to aid law enforcement, provide information to veterinarians, and encourage ranchers to report similar incidents.\n\nSummary of the Cases:\n\n\t1.\tCase #1 (March 10, 1997, NE Utah):\n\t•\tA newborn calf was found eviscerated 45 minutes after being tagged.\n\t•\tThe mutilation occurred in broad daylight, with ranchers only 300 yards away.\n\t•\tOver 60% of the calf’s body weight was removed, and no blood was found at the scene.\n\t•\tA sharp instrument was used to remove the calf’s ear and other body parts.\n\t•\tNo tracks or evidence were found around the scene, even after a thorough search.\n\t2.\tCase #2 (November 10, 2001, Northern California):\n\t•\tA Black Angus calf was found with its left eye cored out and the muzzle cut off.\n\t•\tOver 60% of the body mass was removed, with no blood found at the scene.\n\t•\tThe mother of the calf avoided the carcass, and no tracks were discernible.\n\t3.\tCase #3 (December 29, 2001, Northern California):\n\t•\tA premature Charolais calf was found with its head skinned and severed.\n\t•\tThe body was clean with no signs of blood, and the cuts appeared smooth and deliberate.\n\t•\tThe ranchers reported unusual activity the night before, including dogs barking, a horse seeking protection, and the sound of a helicopter.\n\nDiscussion:\nThe cases are considered outliers compared to typical animal mutilation incidents. The report suggests that the killings were performed with hostile intent and involved the use of sharp instruments, ruling out predators or scavengers. NIDS encourages further reporting and investigation of similar cases.\n\nConclusion:\nThe report documents these unusual cases to aid in future investigations and to alert those who may encounter similar incidents. NIDS offers to collaborate with ranchers, veterinarians, and law enforcement to understand and address these occurrences.","date":"2002-02-01 00:00:00+00","embedding":null,"file":[{"enablePublicUrl":true,"id":"56uc46vmst5u5f062opskkkado","mediaType":"application/pdf","name":"Killing of Calves Feb 2002.pdf","signedUrlTimeout":600,"size":3391721,"storageKey":"kgubvq7h5olkcflh5g1djs425hnbcpkc","uploadKey":"cqvbq9sh53f5ro7dfvmg","uploadUrlTimeout":86400,"version":1}],"id":"rec_cqvbq9sh53f5ro7dfvm0","organization":"rec_cqvbi40lcojovqh6jao0","title":"“The Killing of Calves” by the National Institute for Discovery Science (NIDS), February 2002","url":null,"xata":{"createdAt":"2024-08-16 02:44:55.808769+00","updatedAt":"2024-08-16 02:47:33.857808+00","version":1}},{"author":"rec_cobdfd4jmvif9dabl100","content":"John Lear 1987","date":"1987-08-01 00:00:00+00","embedding":null,"file":[{"enablePublicUrl":true,"id":"uv4q2ukhtd5fda3ue3c8pa35fk","mediaType":"video/mp4","name":"John Lear 1987.mp4","signedUrlTimeout":600,"size":0,"storageKey":"iel1pg16r96greble1shbo6vd4","uploadKey":"cokjusn758af7femsoag","uploadUrlTimeout":86400,"version":1}],"id":"rec_cokjusn758af7femsoa0","organization":null,"title":"John Lear Interview w/ George Knapp","url":null,"xata":{"createdAt":"2024-04-24 17:20:50.518909+00","updatedAt":"2024-08-16 02:53:21.958671+00","version":1}},{"author":"rec_cqvbg98lcojovqh6jan0","content":"\nThe main argument presented in this paper is that the continuing study of unidentified aerial phenomena (\"UAP\") may offer an existence theorem for new models of physical reality. The current SETI paradigm and its \"assumption of mediocrity\" place restrictions on forms of non-human intelligence that may be researched. A similar bias exists in the ufologists' often-stated hypothesis that UAP, if real, must represent space visitors. Observing that both models are biased by anthropomorph ism, the authors attempt to clarify the issues surrounding \"high strangeness\" observations by distinguishing six layers of information that can be derived from UAP events, namely (1) physical manifestations, (2) anti-physical effects, (3) psychological factors, (4) physiological factors, (5) psychic effects and (6) cultural effects. In a further step they propose a framework for scientific analysis of unidentified aerial phenomena that takes into account the incommensurability problem.","date":"2003-01-01 00:00:00+00","embedding":null,"file":[{"enablePublicUrl":true,"id":"i1ru7pja0t1fj6766ducrv79is","mediaType":"application/pdf","name":"Incommensurability_Orthodoxy_and_the_Physics_of_Hi.pdf","signedUrlTimeout":600,"size":161216,"storageKey":"43g81i6igd76ff1mek813kj75o","uploadKey":"cp2epkl4mibkl2ugm0sg","uploadUrlTimeout":86400,"version":1}],"id":"rec_cp2epkl4mibkl2ugm0s0","organization":null,"title":"Incommensurability, Orthodoxy and the Physics of High Strangeness: a 6-layer Model for Anomalous Phenomena","url":null,"xata":{"createdAt":"2024-05-15 17:11:46.630739+00","updatedAt":"2024-08-16 02:52:04.719837+00","version":1}},{"author":"rec_cobdfd4jmvif9dabl100","content":null,"date":"2024-07-26 00:00:00+00","embedding":null,"file":[{"enablePublicUrl":true,"id":"vmb47inbsl47j4iovhoror5gp8","mediaType":"application/pdf","name":"HHRG 118 GO06 July 26.pdf","signedUrlTimeout":600,"size":163594,"storageKey":"kgubvq8mnu6uj2id147c5op7h0u76v74","uploadKey":"cqvc458lcojovqh6jbng","uploadUrlTimeout":86400,"version":0}],"id":"rec_cqvc458lcojovqh6jbn0","organization":null,"title":"Statement to Congress","url":null,"xata":{"createdAt":"2024-08-16 03:05:57.352133+00","updatedAt":"2024-08-16 03:05:57.352133+00","version":0}}],"total":0}
