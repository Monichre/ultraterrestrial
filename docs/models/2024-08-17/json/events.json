It occurred in December 1980 near Rendlesham Forest in Suffolk, England, close to the RAF Woodbridge and RAF Bentwaters, which were used by the United States Air Force (USAF) at the time[1][2].\n\n### Main Events\n\n#### December 26, 1980\nAround 3:00 AM on December 26, 1980, USAF personnel reported seeing unexplained lights descending into the forest. The lights were initially thought to be a downed aircraft. Upon investigation, servicemen, including Sergeant Jim Penniston, reported encountering a glowing, metallic object with colored lights. The object appeared to move through the trees, causing nearby farm animals to go into a frenzy. Local police were called but only observed lights from the Orfordness Lighthouse[1].\n\nAfter daylight, servicemen found three small impressions on the ground in a triangular pattern, alongside burn marks and broken branches. These impressions were thought by local police to possibly be made by animals[1].\n\n#### December 28, 1980\nTwo nights later, on December 28, more strange lights were reported. Lt. Col. Charles Halt led a team into the forest and recorded his observations on a tape recorder. They noted abnormal radiation levels at the site and witnessed a red light moving through the trees, which then broke into multiple objects and moved across the sky[5].\n\n### Investigation and Theories\n\nThe UK Ministry of Defence did not consider the incident a threat to national security and therefore did not conduct a formal investigation. Skeptics have suggested that the sightings could be attributed to a combination of a fireball, the Orfordness Lighthouse, and bright stars[2].\n\nDespite the lack of official investigation, the incident has been the subject of numerous books, articles, and documentaries. Some theories suggest it could have been a misinterpretation of natural phenomena or even a secret military operation. Others believe it involved extraterrestrial activity[2][5].\n\n### Cultural Impact\n\nThe incident has achieved legendary status, akin to the Loch Ness Monster or King Arthur. Rendlesham Forest now features a UFO trail, complete with a replica of a flying saucer, attracting tourists and UFO enthusiasts[2]. The case remains a topic of debate and speculation, with some believing it was part of a Cold War-related cover-up[2][5].\n\nCitations:\n[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendlesham_Forest_incident\n[2] https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-suffolk-54649675\n[3] https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna32451823\n[4] https://www.amazon.com/Encounter-Rendlesham-Forest-Best-Documented-Incident/dp/1250038103\n[5] https://science.howstuffworks.com/space/aliens-ufos/rendlesham-forest-incident.htm\n\nUnited States Air Force personnel reported various unusual\nobservations at RAF Woodbridge and RAF Bentwaters, two\nAmerican air bases located in England.

Hours later, the Army announced that the find was a\ncrashed weather balloon. In 1978, the case regained attention\nafter Jesse Marcel, the Army Officer who recovered the\nwreckage, told UFO researchers that the weather balloon\nexplanation was a cover story. In 1994, the Air Force attributed\nthe incident to the previously classified Project Mogul. [61]\n\nThe Roswell incident is a significant event in UFO history, occurring in 1947 near Roswell, New Mexico. It has been the subject of numerous conspiracy theories regarding extraterrestrial life and government cover-ups.\n\n## Initial Incident and Military Response\n\nIn June 1947, a rancher named W.W. \"Mac\" Brazel discovered unusual debris on his property, including tinfoil, rubber strips, and sticks. He reported this to the local sheriff, who contacted the Roswell Army Air Field (RAAF). The RAAF issued a press release claiming they had recovered a \"flying disc\" from the ranch, which made international headlines. However, the military quickly retracted the statement, asserting that the debris was from a weather balloon, not a flying saucer[2][3].\n\n## Project Mogul\n\nThe debris was later revealed to be part of Project Mogul, a top-secret U.S. military operation aimed at detecting Soviet nuclear tests using high-altitude balloons. This revelation came in 1994, but it did little to quell the conspiracy theories surrounding the incident[3].\n\n## Conspiracy Theories and Cultural Impact\n\nThe incident faded from public attention until 1978, when retired Air Force officer Jesse Marcel claimed the weather balloon explanation was a cover-up. This claim fueled speculation that the debris was of extraterrestrial origin, leading to the publication of the book \"The Roswell Incident\" in 1980. This book and subsequent claims expanded the narrative to include alien bodies, government cover-ups, and reverse-engineered alien technology[2][3].\n\nThe Roswell incident has since become a cultural phenomenon, inspiring numerous books, films, and television shows. The city of Roswell capitalizes on this association, hosting an annual UFO festival and housing the International UFO Museum and Research Center[3].\n\n## Official Reports and Skepticism\n\nIn 1997, the U.S. Air Force released \"The Roswell Report: Case Closed,\" which suggested that stories of alien bodies might have originated from witnesses misremembering events involving crash test dummies and other unrelated incidents. Despite these official explanations, many UFO enthusiasts remain convinced of a government cover-up[3].\n\nOverall, the Roswell incident remains a pivotal moment in UFO lore, symbolizing the enduring fascination and skepticism surrounding extraterrestrial life and government transparency.\n\nThe initial media coverage of the Roswell incident in 1947 was marked by sensational headlines and rapid retractions. On July 8, 1947, the Roswell Army Air Field (RAAF) issued a press release stating that they had recovered a \"flying disc\" from a ranch near Roswell, New Mexico. This announcement was quickly picked up by the media, with the *Roswell Daily Record* running a headline that read, \"RAAF Captures Flying Saucer On Ranch in Roswell Region\" [2].\n\nHowever, almost immediately after this initial report, the military retracted their statement, claiming that the debris was actually from a weather balloon. The *Roswell Morning Dispatch* followed up with a headline on July 9, 1947, stating, \"Army Debunks Roswell Flying Disk as World Simmers with Excitement,\" which reflected the military's revised explanation that the object was a weather balloon carrying a radar target [2][4].\n\nThe swift change in the official narrative contributed to public intrigue and skepticism, setting the stage for the enduring conspiracy theories that would later surround the incident. Despite the retraction, the initial claim of a \"flying disc\" had already captured public attention, leading to widespread speculation about the possibility of extraterrestrial involvement [1][2].\n\nCitations:\n[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roswell_incident\n[2] https://www.britannica.com/event/Roswell-incident\n[3] https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GAOREPORTS-NSIAD-95-187/html/GAOREPORTS-NSIAD-95-187.htm\n[4] https://www.cbsnews.com/news/roswell-ufo-incident-1947-headline-dispatch/\n[5] https://libraries.uta.edu/roswell/images\n\nCitations:\n[1] https://www.af.mil/The-Roswell-Report/\n[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roswell_incident\n[3] https://www.britannica.com/event/Roswell-incident\n[4] https://www.amazon.com/Roswell-UFO-Crash-Really-Happened/dp/1933424273\n[5] https://libraries.uta.edu/roswell/images","id":"rec_cobdg3tbjt595h637700","latitude":33.400322,"location":"Roswell, New Mexico , United States","longitude":-104.534897,"name":"The\nRoswell\nIncident","photos":[{"attributes":{"height":1226,"width":2297},"enablePublicUrl":true,"id":"ijf04u2fgl6bn33j7sm4di05co","mediaType":"image/jpeg","name":"roswell.jpeg","signedUrlTimeout":600,"size":1217415,"storageKey":"klr0b64iqp6ob9jkcrnq36a8is","uploadKey":"cq5al9b29bhdoikd5ba0","uploadUrlTimeout":86400,"version":3},{"attributes":{"height":669,"width":601},"enablePublicUrl":true,"id":"bpcephsibh719476bp7jnvnfc4","mediaType":"image/png","name":"r3.png","signedUrlTimeout":600,"size":168354,"storageKey":"kgubvq8jal0sp6l4lf62lph8so","uploadKey":"cqqe700uecie37hln470","uploadUrlTimeout":86400,"version":0},{"attributes":{"height":586,"width":784},"enablePublicUrl":true,"id":"7g42ua4rbh6rv2t1cge5ikaivo","mediaType":"image/png","name":"r1.png","signedUrlTimeout":600,"size":382702,"storageKey":"kgubvq5u2l3m99lpmj1741uqsg","uploadKey":"cqqe700uecie37hln47g","uploadUrlTimeout":86400,"version":0},{"attributes":{"height":265,"width":264},"enablePublicUrl":true,"id":"efkqudegs12or8uhmka8mev8d0","mediaType":"image/png","name":"r2.png","signedUrlTimeout":600,"size":55300,"storageKey":"kgubvqq48d66d96r9jv8h9akq0","uploadKey":"cqqe700uecie37hln480","uploadUrlTimeout":86400,"version":0}],"xata":{"createdAt":"2024-04-10 18:18:55.626399+00","updatedAt":"2024-08-08 15:25:52.925265+00","version":9}},{"date":"1945-01-01 05:00:00+00","description":"According to one account, a large, avocado-shaped flying\nobject struck a communication tower in a patch of New Mexico\ndesert now known as the Trinity Site, where the world's first\natomic bomb was detonated in July 1945.

This event was accompanied by sightings of extraterrestrial beings, which they described in detail during their emergency calls and subsequent interactions with the police.\n\nDetails of the Incident\n\n\nLate in the evening on April 30, leading into the early hours of May 1, the family experienced something extraordinary. They reported seeing a bright object falling from the sky, accompanied by a significant impact that they felt physically. The family, including a man, his father, and his brother, were in their backyard at the time, working on a truck when this incident occurred.\n\nTestimonies and Descriptions of the Beings\n\n\nThe primary witness, during a 911 call, described the beings as very large, estimating their height to be between eight to ten feet. He emphasized repeatedly that these beings were \"not human.\" The beings were described as having big, shiny eyes and a non-human appearance, which left the witnesses terrified. This description was consistent across various accounts provided by the family.\n\nPolice and Investigative Response\n\n\nThe Las Vegas Metropolitan Police responded to the scene and conducted an investigation. Officers on site and their bodycam footage captured part of the event, although some details were obscured due to privacy concerns. The police were initially skeptical but decided to investigate further after multiple reports aligned with the family's account. Despite the investigation, the exact nature of what crashed and the beings observed remains unclear, with official sources suggesting various possibilities, including rare atmospheric phenomena.\n\nPublic and Media Reaction\n\n\nThe incident attracted significant media attention, with various news outlets and social media platforms featuring the story. The family's testimony was supported by other independent reports of a bright streak across the sky that night, adding credibility to their claims. However, there was also skepticism, particularly regarding a video that surfaced later, which was suspected to be manipulated due to inconsistencies in the recording date and the actual event.\n\nConclusion\n\n\nThe Las Vegas UFO and alien sighting remains a topic of intrigue and speculation. The combination of physical evidence, multiple witness testimonies, and the intense reaction from both the public and authorities highlights the continuing fascination with and fear of the unknown, particularly regarding extraterrestrial life and unidentified flying objects.\n\nThis incident involves two stories that have been brought together as one — the observation of a bright streak of light in the skies over Las Vegas, Nevada and a 911 call that was placed shortly after to report something unusual in a family's backyard.\n\nOn April 30, 2023 around 11:50 PM, a police officer's body camera video recorded something streaking low across the sky. Several people across eastern California, Nevada, Arizona, and Utah reported seeing the flash, according to the American Meteor Society. Reports of the object by Las Vegas residents describe the phenomenon.\n\n\"It looked like a giant shooting star, but was extremely close to earth.\"\n\"First red then green then glowing white; bright like an explosion.\"\n\"Light Blue, Light Green\"\n\"Green, Light Green\"\n\"Green, Light Green, Orange, Yellow, Light Yellow; it has a sparkling trail that lasted a few seconds at most\"\n\"Fizzling or crackling\"\nAt 12:25 AM, a call is received by a 911 dispatcher from an individual in the Northwest Valley of Las Vegas, Nevada. According to the caller, an object has landed in their backyard and there are multiple creatures nearby, standing 8-10 feet tall. A nearby Ring doorbell camera appears to have caught the moment that the object impacted. It has since been determined that the original Ring doorbell video was filmed several weeks earlier when a fireball shot across the Las Vegas sky.\n\nCaller: \"There's like an 8-foot person beside it and another one is inside us and it has big eyes and it's looking at us — and it's still there,\" the caller told a dispatcher.\n\nDispatcher: \"OK, where is this on your property?\"\n\nCaller: \"In my backyard. I swear to God this is not a joke, this is actually — we're terrified.\"\n\nDispatcher: \"So, there's two people, there's two subjects in your backyard?\"\n\nCaller: \"Correct and they're very large. They're like 8 foot, 9 feet, 10 foot. They look like aliens to us. Big eyes. They have big eyes. Like, I can't explain it, and big mouth. They're shiny eyes and they're human. They're 100% not human.\"\n\nDispatcher:\"OK.?\"\n\nThe Las Vegas Metro police dispatcher call log for the incident.\nThe Las Vegas Metro police dispatcher call log for the incident.\nAt 1:04 AM, officer's body camera captures the meeting with the family that placed the 911 call.\n\nOfficer: \"What did you see?\"\n\nWitness: \"It was like a, it was like a big creature.\"\n\nOfficer: \"A big creature?\"\n\nWitness: \"Yea, more than 10 feet tall.\"\n\nOfficer: \"I'm not going to BS, you guys. One of my partners said they saw something fall out of the sky, too. So that's why I'm kind of curious.\"\n\nWitness: \"I don't believe in it but what I saw right now, I do believe in it.\"\n\nOfficer: \"You guys seem, like, legit scared so I don't blame you.\"\n\nOfficer: \"Hey, if those 9-foot beings come back, don't call us, alright. Deal with it yourself,\" the officer joked as they were leaving.\n\nBodycam footage of the alleged UFO landing site. It has since been determined that this pattern exists on earlier Google Earth images.\nBodycam footage of the alleged UFO landing site. It has since been determined that this pattern exists on earlier Google Earth images.\nThe incident was witnessed by at least three people in the family. These witnesses also reported hearing footsteps on the roof and recalled that the creatures were communicating, or appeared to be whispering to one another. One of the witnesses reported being \"frozen\" by the creature and was unable to move. He was close enough to see and hear one of the creatures breathing. The spot where the object landed was \"obscured and blurry, as if by unknown form of camouflage\", according to local news reports.\n\nIt was reported in the days following the event that government vehicles were spotted driving near the subject property. At least one retired Las Vegas Metro police officer has acknowledged staking out the house in the days following the event.\n\nThis incident was first reported by 8 News NOW Las Vegas on June 7, 2023.\n\nRemaining Questions\nWhy did it take so long for the public to hear about the event (over a month)?\nWhat landed in their backyard?\nWas this an extraterrestrial encounter?\nWhat's clear is that something was witnessed flying overhead by the residents of Las Vegas, Nevada that evening.

According to some residents, they found\nan acorn-shaped object in the woods. The U.S. military closed off\nthe area to investigate and reported no evidence of a crash. A\nmodel built for Unsolved Mysteries is kept on display by the fire\ndepartment, which leads an annual UFO celebration. [110][111][112]At approximately 4:45 p.m. on the afternoon of December 9, 1965, several reports of a “fireball” streaking through the sky were reported by residents of several states including Pennsylvania, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, West Virginia, New York, and Canadian observers. Witnesses included weather observers and Canadian Coast Guard personnel. The sightings received additional corroboration from airplane pilots who described seeing a “flash of orange fire” in the sky coinciding with the reports, and witnesses in several states described seeing what they believed to be “falling debris” accompanying the fireball. Andrew Rosepiler, a resident of Midland, Pennsylvania, saw the object while driving, and “judged the object about the size of a football” with a long, trailing tail of fire and smoke. Another observer in the nearby township of Patterson claimed her son had observed, “a big ball of fire fall into the woods and the woods are smoking.” One pilot observer, Raymond Wallings of Ohio, was flying over Lake Erie when he observed a fireball that he watched until he believed it “plummeted into the lake.” Early speculations about what the object had been included a meteor, as well as the launch of a test rocket over Lake Erie, although Coast Guard and Air Force officials later confirmed that no rocket launch had occurred. ³ Several small grass fires were also reported in various parts of Ohio and Pennsylvania coinciding with sightings of the fireball.\nAccording to a Memo for the Record from the Project Blue Book case file for the Kecksburg incident dated December 10, 1965, a Major Howard from the Pentagon contacted the Air Force requesting information that could be given to the press about the fireball sighting the previous day. The memo states that Quintanilla “told him that a team of men were sent out from the Oakdale Radar Site in Oakdale, Pennsylvania,” who helped with the search near Kecksburg “until 2 o’clock, and were unsuccessful in finding the object.” The memo adds that detections of the object had been visual, and that it “was not picked up by radar,” and that the team of men who were sent out to pick up the object “worked along with the State Highway Patrol in trying to recover the object.” Quintanilla advised the Pentagon “to call it a meteor that entered the atmosphere,” though adding that the investigation was still ongoing, and that “There was no space debris which entered the atmosphere on 9 December 1965.” Similar memos issued on the same date further detail that a metallic substance located around the time of the fireball sighting was radar chaff foiling material recovered near La Pierre, Michigan.\nIn the decades after the incident, several individuals eventually came forward claiming to have observed an object in the wooded area where U.S. Air Force personnel and Pennsylvania State Highway Patrol workers conducted their search on the evening of December 9, 1965. Testimony from these individuals, collected by Pennsylvania investigator Stan Gordon, detailed observations of a “large metallic acorn-shaped object partially buried in the ground,” large enough for a man to stand within. The object was described as bronze or gold in color, and no rivets or seams were visible on its surfaces. Some individuals also said they observed unusual markings or “hieroglyphics” on portions of the object. Investigative reporter Leslie Kean, with help from the Washington law firm Lobel, Novins, and Lamont and others associated with the Sci Fi Channel, filed a lawsuit under the Freedom of Information Act to attempt to obtain records from NASA about the incident in a UFO advocacy initiative that became known as the Coalition for Freedom of Information (CFi). Two years later, in advance of the 40th anniversary of the Kecksburg incident, the space agency issued a statement saying that the incident had involved the reentry of a Russian satellite, but that two boxes of records pertaining to the incident “have been lost.” Dave Steitz, a NASA spokesperson, said that fragments from the object had been collected and studied by NASA scientists, but that records related to this had been misplaced sometime in the 1990s.","id":"rec_cobdg3tbjt595h6376f0","latitude":40.1848,"location":" Kecksburg, Pennsylvania NA, United States","longitude":-79.4606,"name":"Kecksburg\nUFO incident","photos":[],"xata":{"createdAt":"2024-04-10 18:18:55.626399+00","updatedAt":"2024-05-14 23:47:44.596566+00","version":4}},{"date":"1965-09-03 05:00:00+00","description":"Numerous people reported pulsating UFOs in Exeter, New\nHampshire.

It involved thousands of witnesses observing a series of lights moving across the sky, which has since become one of the most documented UFO events in history.\n\n## Overview of the Event\n\nOn the night of March 13, 1997, thousands of people in Arizona reported seeing a series of bright lights in a V-shaped formation moving across the sky. The event occurred between 7:30 PM and 10:30 PM, with sightings reported from the Nevada state line, through Phoenix, and into Tucson. The lights were described as being attached to a large, silent craft, and the phenomenon lasted for several hours[3].\n\n## Explanations and Theories\n\nThe Phoenix Lights have been subject to various explanations and theories:\n\n1. **Military Exercises**: One explanation suggested that the lights were high-intensity flares dropped by the military during exercises at the nearby Luke Air Force Base. This theory was supported by the fact that similar lights were later identified as flares in other incidents[2].\n\n2. **UFO and Extraterrestrial Theories**: Many people, including some witnesses, believe the lights were evidence of extraterrestrial visitation. This belief was bolstered by the sheer number of witnesses and the lack of a definitive explanation at the time[1].\n\n3. **Skeptical Views**: Skeptics have proposed more mundane explanations, such as aircraft lights or natural phenomena. Some have pointed out that lights in the sky can often be misidentified due to their distance and the observer's perspective[2].\n\n## Impact and Legacy\n\nThe Phoenix Lights have had a lasting impact on UFOlogy and public interest in extraterrestrial life. The event has been the subject of books, documentaries, and ongoing debates. Dr. Lynne D. Kitei, a prominent figure in the study of the Phoenix Lights, has documented the event extensively and argues for its significance in UFO history[1].\n\nFormer Arizona Governor Fife Symington, who initially mocked the sighting, later admitted that he witnessed the event and described it as \"otherworldly\"[1]. The Phoenix Lights continue to be a topic of interest and speculation, contributing to discussions about UFOs and the possibility of extraterrestrial life.\n\nThe Phoenix Lights event had a significant impact on public opinion regarding UFOs, contributing to a broader interest and belief in extraterrestrial phenomena. Here are some key aspects of its impact:\n\n1. **Increased Public Interest**: The Phoenix Lights incident is considered one of the most widely witnessed UFO events in history, drawing attention from both the public and media. This widespread attention has kept the event in the public consciousness and has fueled ongoing curiosity and discussion about UFOs and extraterrestrial life[1][2].\n\n2. **Shift in Skepticism**: The event led some skeptics to reconsider their views on UFOs. For instance, former Arizona Governor Fife Symington, who initially mocked the sightings, later admitted to witnessing the event and described it as \"otherworldly\"[4]. This shift among notable figures has contributed to a more open public discourse on the possibility of extraterrestrial life.\n\n3. **Cultural and Media Influence**: The Phoenix Lights have been featured in documentaries, books, and media reports, contributing to the cultural narrative surrounding UFOs. Dr. Lynne D. Kitei's work on documenting and promoting awareness of the Phoenix Lights has played a significant role in maintaining public interest and advancing discussions on UFO disclosure[4].\n\n4. **Community and Legacy**: The event has become a part of Arizona's cultural identity, with annual commemorations and community events celebrating the sighting. This has helped keep the topic alive in public discourse and has encouraged ongoing investigation and debate[1][3].\n\nOverall, the Phoenix Lights incident has had a lasting impact on public opinion by increasing interest in UFOs, challenging skepticism, and becoming a significant part of cultural and media narratives surrounding extraterrestrial phenomena.\n\nCitations:\n[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjv9EmaBaVw\n[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Lights\n[3] https://www.axios.com/local/phoenix/2024/03/13/lights-arizona-ufo-legend-1997\n[4] https://www.amazon.com/Phoenix-Lights-Skeptics-Discovery-Alone/dp/1571746323\n[5] https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA182976232\u0026issn=10639330\u0026it=r\u0026linkaccess=abs\u0026p=AONE\u0026sid=googleScholar\u0026sw=w\u0026v=2.1\n\nCitations:\n[1] https://www.amazon.com/Phoenix-Lights-Skeptics-Discovery-Alone/dp/1571746323\n[2] https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/phoenix-ufo-mystery-solved-lights-high-school-football/story?id=14884994\n[3] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjv9EmaBaVw\n[4] https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA182976232\u0026issn=10639330\u0026it=r\u0026linkaccess=abs\u0026p=AONE\u0026sid=googleScholar\u0026sw=w\u0026v=2.1\n[5] https://www.amazon.com/Phoenix-Lights-Lynne-D-Kitei/dp/1571743774","id":"rec_cobdg3tbjt595h6375r0","latitude":33.4484,"location":" Phoenix, Arizona, USA","longitude":-112.074,"name":"Phoenix Lights","photos":[{"attributes":{"height":584,"width":785},"enablePublicUrl":true,"id":"5mg18j5g617mh3c8bs2antjpas","mediaType":"image/png","name":"phoenix.png","signedUrlTimeout":600,"size":49148,"storageKey":"kgubvqkgs522fffae5vo1k9v24","uploadKey":"cqqdk2rjbj646447ct7g","uploadUrlTimeout":86400,"version":0},{"attributes":{"height":248,"width":298},"enablePublicUrl":true,"id":"4oqp8amcdp3ddf0imm4m41aar0","mediaType":"image/png","name":"ph-2.png","signedUrlTimeout":600,"size":59680,"storageKey":"kgubvqbd611i1agj24hdn24gu4","uploadKey":"cqqdk33jbj646447ct80","uploadUrlTimeout":86400,"version":0}],"xata":{"createdAt":"2024-04-10 18:18:55.626399+00","updatedAt":"2024-08-08 14:45:32.298835+00","version":6}},{"date":"2004-11-14 06:00:00+00","description":"Several pilots from VFA-41 squadron flying Super Hornets from\nthe USS Nimitz, were directed by the USS Princeton to intercept\none of several unidentified flying objects detected by radar. The\npilots reported a visual encounter and recorded an infrared video.\nThe Navy has verified that the video was taken by Navy\npersonnel and has stated that it has not yet identified the nature\nof the sightings which they classify as unexplained aerial\nphenomena. During a routine training mission with the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz off the southern California coast on November 14th, 2004, U.S. Navy Lieutenant Commander Alex Dietrich and her then-commanding officer, David Fravor, received a request from another warship to interrupt their routine training mission to investigate strangely moving radar contacts in the area.\n“We’ve been tracking these things for two weeks...this is the first time we’ve had planes airborne and we want you to go see what these are,” Fravor remembers the U.S.S. Princeton officer telling him.\nWhen the pilots reached the assigned location, they spotted a disturbance under the water that Fravor thought looked something like the size of a Boeing 737 airplane. Dietrich and Fravor then saw what they described as a smooth, white oblong object resembling a Tic Tac flying at high speed across the water—Dietrich estimated that it was skimming 500 to 1,000 feet above the water at around 500 knots (575 mph).\nDietrich’s F/A-18 Super Hornet’s onboard radar couldn’t detect the object, but her weapons systems operator (WSO), who has remained anonymous, was sitting in the rear seat and saw it too.\nDietrich recalled. Speculating about what it could be, she said, “we don’t know what it was, but it could have been a natural phenomenon in human activity. But the point was that it was weird, and we couldn’t recognize it.” In a CBS 60 Minutes interview, she noted how it had no “predictable movement and no predictable trajectory.”\nFravor described it as a “ping pong ball...very random.” Fravor turned to “engage” with the object, which responded in a way that “lacked any visible flight control surfaces or means of propulsion,”\nIt then turned abruptly and “started mirroring” Fravor’s aircraft as he began a slow circular descent toward it. \nHe then made the decision to cut across and head directly toward the object, at which point it disappeared. The underwater object had also disappeared. The fighters conferred with the Princeton and were told to head to a rendezvous point about 60 miles away, where the object had appeared again. However, when they arrived, it had disappeared once more.\nAn hour after Fravor’s group of pilots witnessed the object, Lieutenant Commander Chad Underwood managed to capture the object on video.","id":"rec_cobdg3tbjt595h6375p0","latitude":32.7157,"location":" San Diego, California, USA","longitude":-117.1611,"name":"USS Nimitz UFO Encounter","photos":[{"enablePublicUrl":true,"id":"26122a8l1t2arah00p6hv6cj2k","mediaType":"image/webp","name":"USS Nimitz UFO.webp","signedUrlTimeout":600,"size":23598,"storageKey":"051nnsavpt28t1j5psjs9jc1v4","uploadKey":"cqqavnui2o4pnhq1901g","uploadUrlTimeout":86400,"version":1},{"enablePublicUrl":true,"id":"e6crjuemi12sna0a90qu884kf8","mediaType":"image/webp","name":"USS Nimitz in Middle East.webp","signedUrlTimeout":600,"size":517706,"storageKey":"gorkvsn7nd4jf4085i2oc85mto","uploadKey":"cqqb7iui2o4pnhq1906g","uploadUrlTimeout":86400,"version":0},{"enablePublicUrl":true,"id":"kjbhend4td2mbc62j4ngfkr7dc","mediaType":"image/webp","name":"USS Nimitz 1000w.webp","signedUrlTimeout":600,"size":141218,"storageKey":"avi6mhb9qt2s7b22pblcnsoh3s","uploadKey":"cqqb7iui2o4pnhq19070","uploadUrlTimeout":86400,"version":0},{"enablePublicUrl":true,"id":"c3n66tua4l7f9ff26r7ocaiaj8","mediaType":"video/mp4","name":"FLIR1_Official_UAP_Footage_from_the_USG_for_Public_Release.webm.360p.webm.mp4","signedUrlTimeout":600,"size":4591425,"storageKey":"ugf142ojsp2s3dmuf8sr877nk4","uploadKey":"cqqb7iui2o4pnhq1907g","uploadUrlTimeout":86400,"version":0}],"xata":{"createdAt":"2024-04-10 18:18:55.626399+00","updatedAt":"2024-08-08 12:02:20.111889+00","version":9}},{"date":"1994-09-16 05:00:00+00","description":"Over sixty students reported seeing a silver craft land in a field\nnear the school.

Pirouzi received the first of four sightings reports: a call from a woman northeast of the airport who saw a luminous object glowing red, yellow, and orange. It was shaped like a four-blade fan, and seemed to split in two. A few minutes later, another caller reported a similar object in the same area of the sky, one which also split in two and then rejoined as one.\nThe tower radar was under repair, so Pirouzi could not confirm the UFO, but after receiving two more calls in the next half hour, he stepped outside to look through his binoculars: in the direction of the callers' sightings, he saw a luminous cylindrical object sitting horizontally in the sky about 1.8 kilometers, or 6000 feet, off the ground. He guessed that it was 8 meters wide, or just over 26 feet. Each end was glowing blue, and a red light was making an orbit around the center every second or two, and pausing every 90 degrees. The entire cylinder was rocking back and forth like a seesaw.\nAs it got closer, Pirouzi saw it slowly change into a drooping star-shape with a green body and a red glowing core. The arms of the star were dark orange, fading to yellow at the tips. It seemed to have four arms, though Pirouzi believed that there was actually only one arm, switching positions. When Pirouzi's trainees looked through the binoculars shortly after, they saw a semi-circle. The object seemed to be constantly changing shape.\nTwo F-4 Iranian Airforce jets were scrambled to investigate the UAP, lost instrumentation and communications as they approached it, and suffered temporary weapons systems failure while preparing to open fire. The UAP was seen both visually by the pilots and on radar.\nThe incident is recorded in a four page U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) paper which was distributed to the White House, Secretary of State, Joint Chiefs of Staff, NSA and CIA. It is one of the most well-documented military encounters with anomalous phenomena. The case is also exemplary for its mix of radar data, physical effects on military craft (such as the loss of weapons control), and multiple independent witnesses from different geographical locations and physical viewpoints (both airborne and from the ground). The case is also notable for the international collaboration of the investigations; U.S. intelligence agencies took over official documentation of the incident.","id":"rec_cp1vddb4f9p514bqa5g0","latitude":null,"location":"Tehran, Iran","longitude":null,"name":"Tehran, Iran, September, 1976","photos":[],"xata":{"createdAt":"2024-05-14 23:41:41.720661+00","updatedAt":"2024-05-14 23:41:41.720661+00","version":0}},{"date":"2010-01-01 00:00:00+00","description":"In 2010, Xiaoshan Airport in Hangzhou – a large international airport serving a major city – was shut down for an hour after a UAP was detected by a flight crew descending into the airport.

A short time later, the deputy commander of the Missile Combat Crew was briefing his superior officer when the alarm horn sounded. Over the next half-minute, all ten of their missiles reported a “No-Go” condition. One by one across the board, each missile had become inoperable.\nLt. Robert Salas, a member of the missile crews, said that the security guard first reported seeing “strange lights in the sky.” Ten minutes later Salas received another call. “This time he was clearly frightened, extremely frightened,” Salas later recalled to a reporter. “He was looking right at the thing, a glowing red object, oval-shaped and about some forty feet in diameter and it was hovering over the gate.”\nA week later, on March 23, the Billings Gazette reported several persons had seen unidentified flying objects over nearby Great Falls and other nearby towns on the night of March 22. “Malmstrom AFB officials said nothing was spotted on base radar and it did not have any planes in the air,” the story concluded.\nThe report piqued local interest. Three years before, a group of children reported a glowing white egg-shaped flying object landed near Helena, a two hour drive south of Malmstrom. The Air Force concluded that the story was a hoax, while parents of the children insisted they believed it.\nIn 2001, researcher John Greenewald obtained five quarterly histories of the 341st Strategic Missile Wing, under the Freedom of Information Act. The reports documented the unit’s activities from January 1, 1967 to March 30, 1968, including the response to what was dubbed “the Echo flight incident.”\nThey revealed that Strategic Air Command headquarters had immediately ordered “a complete engineering analysis of this problem. ”⁵ A technical team determined that loss of strategic alert occurred in an extremely short period of time, “estimated to be between 10 to 40 seconds.”⁶ But the investigators “were unable to determine a logical cause for the incident.”\n“Rumors of Unidentified Flying Objects (UFO) around the area of Echo Flight during the time of fault were disproven,” according to the history.

The witnesses reported seeing large, flat, slow-moving triangular objects with lights underneath. Most witnesses said that the objects were silent. On November 29, 30 groups of civilian witnesses and three groups of police officers reported seeing anomalous aerial objects at low altitudes. Officials tracked these objects moving from Liege to the German border. On March 30, 1990, at 11 pm, a Belgian police captain said he saw a giant triangle passing over, and two ground radar stations also detected the object. These two NATO-operated radar stations contacted other facilities and learned that four other stations also detected objects that did not send transponder signals. Two Air Force F-16s were scrambled to investigate. The pilots attempted nine intercepts but said the objects appeared and disappeared and maneuvered at speeds beyond any known capability, dropping from 10,000 to 500 feet in 5 seconds. They never saw anything by eye that they could not pick up on the radar and returned to the base at 1 am. The local gendarmerie sent a patrol who described seeing four lights in formation making jerky movements before gradually losing their luminosity and disappearing around 1:30 am. There is no photographic evidence from that night - in 1990, a man named Patrick M released photographs, but in 2011 he admitted they were a hoax. Locals filed 143 independent reports in the two weeks following that night.

The object was estimated to be about 22 feet in diameter, and hovered approximately 1500 feet off the ground below a heavy cloud cover for at least 20 minutes before propelling upwards, punching a hole through the cloud. Some witnesses also said the object was spinning. Among the witnesses were managers, runway crew, and airline pilots. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) reported that no air traffic controllers saw the object and that it never showed up on radar, though subsequent FOIA requests revealed this may not have been true.\nThe significance of the case lies principally in its aftermath: media coverage of the event exploded across local, national, and international news, and the FAA came under scrutiny for initially denying the existence of any witness reports from airline personnel. When they were later forced to admit that reports did exist, they still refused to investigate them. The FAA’s response to the event is reflective of a forty-year legacy of U.S. government agencies shielding UFO activity and investigations from the public domain, and the stigma that witnesses may face when coming forward with testimony.\n NARCAP, an independent UFO investigation group, also conducted their own research into the O’Hare incident. A team of NASA scientists, pilots, meteorologists, and aerospace engineers spent 5 months preparing a 154 page report confirming the presence of a physical object over O’Hare. The report, co-authored by NARCAP’s founder Dr. Richard Haines, concluded that the object’s maneuvers could not be explained by conventional means, and advised the FAA to launch their own investigation.","id":"rec_cp1vddb4f9p514bqa5h0","latitude":null,"location":"Chicago O’Hare International Airport, Illinois","longitude":null,"name":"Chicago O’Hare International Airport, Illinois, November, 2006","photos":[],"xata":{"createdAt":"2024-05-14 23:41:41.736429+00","updatedAt":"2024-05-14 23:41:41.736429+00","version":0}},{"date":"1978-01-01 00:00:00+00","description":"On December 21, 1978, at about 11:30 pm, Ian Uffindall, an officer in the Royal New Zealand Air Force, was patrolling an RNZAF base outside the town of Blenheim on the east coast of New Zealand’s southern island when he spotted from the tarmac a light in the sky that he initially took as an aircraft approaching to land. The apparent plane, however, never landed, and so Uffindall went to the base’s control tower and observed the light through binoculars. The light reversed direction and became three lights, which then executed geometric maneuvers while shining beams of light on the ground, Uffindall later recalled to documentarian Paul Davidson in the film The Kaikoura UFO’s.\nThe Blenheim base contacted air traffic control in Wellington, which is across the Cook Strait on the southern tip of New Zealand’s northern island.\nWellington air traffic controller John Cordry confirmed that the lights witnessed by Uffindall appeared as objects on Wellington radar and that the radar station had received multiple calls that night about the lights. Cordry contacted two Safe Air cargo planes that were airborne nearby and asked them to check out the area of the reported lights. (Safe Air, now called Airbus New Zealand LTD, is a freight airplane manufacturer and airline based in Blenheim that has long operated in close cooperation with the RNZAF.)\nOne of the planes, an Argosy ZK-SAE called Merchant Enterprise, headed towards the given coordinates where its captain and pilot, Vern Powell, and its first officer and co-pilot, Ian Pirie, soon observed a bright object emerge from the clouds on the Argosy’s port side.\nPirie later told Davidson the object was “so close it was almost frightening.” “It was the size of a house, burning in the sky,” Pirie said. “It was that sort of color and intensity … That’s what it looked like.” Powell and Pirie observed the light for several minutes, during which time the “target” remained on both Wellington radar and the Argosy’s radar.\nThe crew of the second Safe Air plane also observed strange lights just before 2am.\nThese airborne sightings, which occurred over the Kaikoura Mountains running along the northeastern coast of New Zealand’s southern island, matched numerous sightings from the ground. Several news stories on the sightings ran the following day on television, newspaper and radio. Channel 0 reporter Quentin Fogarty decided to retrace the flight path of the Merchant Enterprise. On December 30, 1978, at 11:46 pm, he took off from Wellington with freelance camera operator David Crockett, and David’s then-wife sound recordist Ngiare Crockett on board.\nA few minutes into the flight, just as Fogarty had just finished delivering an opening for the news story to camera, Startup allegedly called the Channel O crew to the cockpit. All onboard witnessed several lights that first appeared as “pulsating … pinpricks of light that would grow into great globes of light,” according to Fogarty. Reportedly, one light was stronger and apparently larger than the others. The smaller lights seemed to “dip away,” according to Ngaire, and then reappear closer to the larger light.\nDr. Bruce Maccabee, a Mutual UFO Network contributor and physicist specializing in optics at the U.S. Naval Surface Weapons Center, traveled to Australia and New Zealand to investigate the sighting and footage. Maccabbee concluded that the appearance of Venus and Jupiter neither matched the sequence of events, explained the shape of the lights throughout the footage captured by Crockett, were consistent with the way light “scatters” on film, nor explained the radar readings of objects tailing the Argosy at high speeds.\nAs for the size of the UAP captured on film, Maccabee analyzed frames depicting a “bell shaped” UAP at an estimated distance of 10 nautical miles. Accounting for the overexposure on the film, the effect of the camera’s 240 millimeter lens and the UAP’s brightness, which Maccabee estimated to be roughly equivalent to a 350,000 watt incandescent bulb, he estimated the size of the UAP to be about 100 feet wide.","id":"rec_cp1vddb4f9p514bqa5i0","latitude":null,"location":"Unknown","longitude":null,"name":"Kaikoura Mountains, New Zealand, December 21, 1978","photos":[],"xata":{"createdAt":"2024-05-14 23:41:41.781843+00","updatedAt":"2024-05-14 23:41:41.781843+00","version":0}},{"date":"1955-01-01 00:00:00+00","description":"On the night of August 21, 1955, Billy Ray Taylor, while visiting his friends, the Suttons, was convinced he had seen a flying saucer land in a ravine behind the rural Kentucky home. At first the family laughed him off. But soon after, the 11 witnesses present that night claim they saw otherworldly creatures, with undersized bodies and oversized heads. Taylor and Elmer “Lucky” Sutton, grabbed their .22 caliber pistols and went through four boxes of ammunition firing at the interlopers. Then they went to the police.\n“More than a dozen state, county, and city officers from Christian and Hopkins counties went to the scene between 11 p.m. and midnight and remained until after 2 a.m. without seeing anything either to prove or disprove the story about the ship and its occupants,” reported a local newspaper. They were joined by military police from nearby Fort Campbell and a photographer from the Kentucky New Era newspaper. They found no evidence of heavy drinking. According to Glennie Lankford, the matriarch of the Sutton clan, “liquor was not allowed in the farmhouse.”\nThe next day local radio personality and professional sketch artist Andrew \"Bud\" Ledwith interviewed Taylor, Lankford and other adult witnesses and separately asked them to provide descriptions of what they'd seen. The sketch drawings were consistent: the gremlin-like creature was about three feet tall with pointed ears, large claw-like talons, long limbs and legs apparently atrophied as it hovered ghost-like while \"swimming\" through the air.⁵ Reports of the incident attracted the attention of the Air Force UAP investigation program Project Blue Book. The investigators checked with their counterparts at Fort Campbell who had visited the scene but did not pursue the incident further. “Lacking factual, confirming data,” stated one Air Force document declassified 20 years later, “no credence can be given this almost fantastic report.” According to another Blue Book document, “no official investigation was ever made.”\nIsabel Davis, a researcher who wrote up her findings for the Center for UFO Studies in 1955, visited Kelly and was struck by the limited but revealing testimony of Glennie Lankford who said she saw one of the creatures just a few feet away through a screened window. “She was the most impressive witness,” said Russell Greenwell, the police chief of nearby Hopkinsville. “She's the type of person who wouldn't tell a lie if her life depended on it.”\nWhile the Project Blue Book investigators did not find the case credible, their scientific consultant Dr. J. Allen Hynek did, claiming his own investigation yielded no evidence of a hoax. Although the creatures were not reported to be green, this case is often credited as the beginning of the term “little green men” being associated with UAP reports.","id":"rec_cp1vddb4f9p514bqa5ig","latitude":null,"location":"Unknown","longitude":null,"name":"Kelly, Kentucky, August 21, 1955","photos":[],"xata":{"createdAt":"2024-05-14 23:41:41.785404+00","updatedAt":"2024-05-14 23:41:41.785404+00","version":0}},{"date":"1450-01-01 05:50:36+00","description":"After conquering the ancient Nubian city of Napata,\nThutmose III had a stele erected at the Temple of Amun,\nbeneath the Jebel Barkal outcropping.

Nicknamed the \"Westchester Boomerang,” the UAP was described by most witnesses as a huge, hovering V-shaped series of flashing lights connected by a dark craft.\nOn March 24, 1983, a retired police officer observed a group of strange red, green, and white lights forming a V-shape off to the south, which at first he thought was an aircraft in trouble. The UAP moved slowly and a humming sound could be heard in the distance.\nEd Burns, a computer engineer at IBM, was driving home on the Taconic Parkway and had a similar sighting. “I’m not into astronomy… but what I had witnessed that night was not from this planet,” Burns said.\nDennis Sant, a former local government employee, had his sighting in Brewster, New York on March 17, 1983. “It was a very large object. The structure of it was very dark gray, metallic, almost girder-type looking… The object seemed to be very silent. The lights were iridescent, bright, they stood out in the sky and three-dimension. It looked like a city of lights. It just hung in the sky, all brilliant colors… We followed the object around to the backyard. And at that point, a feeling of fright came upon me. Thoughts started to flood my mind, thoughts of the craft touching ground, thoughts of an encounter with an alien being. Thoughts of being abducted. All types of fearful thoughts started to enter into my mind.”\nThese eyewitness testimonials were part of a group of sightings which allegedly continued in the Hudson Valley area for years after. On March 26, 1983, a front-page story in the Westchester-Rockland Daily Item ran the headline: HUNDREDS CLAIM TO HAVE SEEN UFO. The article got the attention of a group of UAP researchers in the area associated with Dr. J. Allen Hynek, a scientific consultant on UAP for the U.S. Air Force. The group started a hotline and received over 300 calls from people that had seen the UAP on the night of March 24. One witness cited in the book “Night Siege,” co-authored by Hynek, said “If there is such a thing as a flying city, this was a flying city.\" The object was seen in nearby Yorktown that evening where the police switchboard became jammed with reports all night long.\nAnother report Hynek’s group received was of a UAP the size of multiple football fields hovering over Indian Point Nuclear Plant. A guard at the power plant described it as being the length of three football fields. Another sighting took place at the Croton Falls Reservoir where allegedly the UAP used a red beam to scan the surface. The research group estimated that over 5,000 people had seen the object from 1982 through 1986 from the Hudson Valley and as far north as Brookfield, Connecticut. Some accounts noted the UAP moving at fast speeds and being able to disappear, and others speculated there could have been multiple crafts.\nThe mystery of the Hudson Valley remains unsolved.","id":"rec_cp1vddb4f9p514bqa5k0","latitude":null,"location":"Unknown","longitude":null,"name":"Hudson Valley, New York, 1983-1986","photos":[],"xata":{"createdAt":"2024-05-14 23:41:41.877967+00","updatedAt":"2024-05-14 23:41:41.877967+00","version":0}},{"date":"1952-07-01 00:00:00+00","description":"At 11:40 p.m. on Saturday, July 19, 1952, an air traffic controller at Washington National Airport spotted seven objects on his radar. The objects were located 15 miles (24 km) south-southwest of the city. No known aircraft were in the area, and the objects were not following any established flight paths. One of the senior traffic controllers later reported, \"we knew immediately that a very strange situation existed.\" Other controllers claimed they saw a hovering \"bright light\" in the sky, which departed with incredible speed. Washington National Controllers called nearby Andrews Air Force base to find out if they saw the same thing. Although Andrews reported they had no unusual objects on radar, Airman William Brady, who was in the tower, reported seeing an \"object which appeared to be like an orange ball of fire, trailing a tail . . . [it was] unlike anything I had ever seen before.\" Soon after, the pilot of a Capital Airlines passenger flight that had just departed Washington National was warned the tower detected several unknown objects were closing on his plane. The pilot claims he then observed six objects–which he described as \"white, tailless, fast-moving lights\" — over 14 minutes. \"Each sighting coincided with a [radar] pip we could see near his plane,\" a controller said later. \"When he reported that the light streaked off at a high speed, it disappeared from our scope.\" ⁶\nAt 3 a.m., shortly before two United States Air Force F-94 Starfire jet fighters from New Castle Air Force Base in Delaware arrived over Washington, all of the objects vanished from the radar at National Airport. However, when the jets ran low on fuel and left, the objects returned, convincing the senior air-traffic controller that \"the UFOs were monitoring radio traffic and behaving accordingly.\" The objects were last detected by radar at 5:30 a.m.\nThe New York Times reported \"Flying Objects Near Washington Spotted by Both Pilots and Radar \" three days later. \"The article cited an unnamed Air Force source who \"received reports of an eerie visitation by unidentified aerial objects–perhaps a new type of \"flying saucer\"–over the vicinity of the nation's capital…\".\nOn July 26, a second sighting occurred over Washington, and the Air Force scrambled F-94 intercept jets to give chase, but the objects vanished. Two days later, the Washington Post ran a front-page article titled, \"'Saucer' Outran Jet, Pilot Reveals.\"\nAt a crowded Pentagon press conference on July 29, prompted by the intense public interest in the sightings due to the newspaper reports, Air Force Chief of Intelligence Major General John Samford said the \"radar blips\" might be due to an atmospheric condition known as \"inversion.\" An inversion is a layer of cool air between layers of warm air, which can, under certain circumstances, reflect radar rays.\"\nWhen the chief of the U.S. Air Force's Project Blue UAP investigation, Capt. Edward J. Ruppelt, checked the data of the Air Defense Command Weather Forecast Center, he ruled out inversion as an explanation. \"On each night that there was a sighting there was a temperature inversion,\" he later wrote. \"but it was never strong enough to affect the radar the way inversions normally do.\" In addition, the second sighting was confirmed by some of his closest associates in the Project Blue Book, including a Navy electronics specialist assigned to the Air Force Directorate of Intelligence, who were in the airport control center. They \"all saw the radar targets and heard the radio conversations as jets tried to intercept the UFO's,\" he said.","id":"rec_cp1vddb4f9p514bqa5kg","latitude":null,"location":"Washington, D.C.","longitude":null,"name":"Washington, D.C., July, 1952","photos":[],"xata":{"createdAt":"2024-05-14 23:41:41.903647+00","updatedAt":"2024-05-14 23:41:41.903647+00","version":0}},{"date":"1993-03-01 00:00:00+00","description":"On March 31, 1993 multiple witnesses across England saw a large triangular-shaped UAP flying in the sky that left a luminous wake in the area of several Royal Air Force (RAF) bases. Ministry of Defence officers reported “a vast triangular shaped craft flying at about 200 feet” that made a low humming noise and fired a beam of light over the ground.

An initial call was received by the Air Defense Command radar station at Ellsworth Air Force Base from the local area Ground Observer Corps filter center shortly after dark, which detailed a sighting of the object from an observer near Black Hawk, South Dakota. According to the account, a woman approximately 10 miles west of the base had described seeing “an extremely bright light low on the horizon” visible to the northeast.\nThe object, according to one initial witness report, “would remain stationary, then hop up several degrees very quickly – almost instantaneously – stop, move to the left and then swerve down in sort of a slanting motion,” thereafter repeating this sequence of movements. Radar operators at Ellsworth had been engaged in a training operation involving an F-84 Thunderjet turbojet fighter flying west of the base at that time the base received the call. The object was observed for several minutes on radar by the warrant officer serving as the duty controller. He said it appeared to be moving slowly at an altitude of approximately 16,000 feet. As the duty controller watched the target moving on his scope toward the southwest, nearby base personnel were ordered to go outside and attempt to obtain a visual on the object. The observers soon reported back that they had spotted “a large bluish-white light” moving in the direction of Rapid City, following a wide circular path over the city before returning to its initial position when first detected on radar.\nFollowing the primary observations of the UAP over Rapid City, the warrant officer contacted the F-84 Thunderjet pilot, who was still on combat air patrol to the west of Ellsworth Air Force Base, advising him that he would be vectored toward the object in an attempted intercept. After a moment, the pilot communicated back to base that he could now see the light ahead in the distance. Closing to within three miles of the object, the UAP suddenly began to move away from the F-84, which the pilot, as well as the radar operator and visual observers back at Ellsworth Air Force Base, all observed simultaneously. Still at 16,000 feet, the UAP began to ascend and accelerate as it veered to the north with the F-84 in pursuit. As the pilot pursued the object, he communicated back to Ellsworth that the object appeared to suddenly brighten at intervals. Each time he would close to within approximately three miles, the craft would “automatically pick up speed and pull away,” as if the source of propulsion that moved the object were directly linked to a form of radar warning system aboard the UAP. The F-84 pilot continued to pursue the object for 120 miles on its northbound course away from Ellsworth, with it continually outpacing the fighter jet. Finally, running low on fuel, the pilot was forced to return to base.\nWithin minutes, a second F-84 was taking off in pursuit of the object, with the pilot quickly obtaining a visual of the UAP and closing toward it. The object began to ascend and moved in a northeasterly direction. As the pilot attempted to climb to the object’s altitude, it maneuvered below him, and resumed its characteristic accelerations each time the pilot approached within three miles of the craft. While pursuing the UAP, the second pilot attempted to discern whether the light could be a reflection caused by lights from his own aircraft, or possibly a celestial object. However, the object indeed appeared to be an airborne light, the source of which remained indiscernible from the pilot’s vantage. The pilot was also successful in detecting the object on his radar. When later interviewed by Project Blue Book Chief Edward Ruppelt, the pilot said that after pursuing the UAP for a period, he became frightened and requested that the controller allow him to abort the intercept. This time, the object did not follow the second pilot back to base and was last observed departing in the direction of Fargo, North Dakota.\nRuppelt said the radar controller had “left the impression he was trying to prove the existence of an unidentified flying object,” noting that the lack of photos depicting the object on the radar scope had been “unfortunate,” although adding that “he saw targets on the scope, there is no doubt about it, but whether they acted exactly as he stated is unknown.” Ruppelt’s general conclusion was that the incident, pending further study, remained unexplained.","id":"rec_cp1vddf6gfslia6urd40","latitude":null,"location":"Ellsworth Air Force Base, Rapid City, South Dakota","longitude":null,"name":"Ellsworth Air Force Base, Rapid City, South Dakota, August, 1953","photos":[],"xata":{"createdAt":"2024-05-14 23:41:41.906428+00","updatedAt":"2024-05-14 23:41:41.906428+00","version":0}},{"date":"1964-09-01 00:00:00+00","description":"On September 4, 1964, scientists allegedly caught a UAP on film during ICBM testing at Vandenberg Air Force Base. Dr. Robert Jacobs was in charge of the testing and had recently acquired a special telescope from Boston University owned by the U.S. Air Force to film the test launches. Many tests were failing, so the U.S. Air Force acquired a telescope to film the tests to determine the reason for the failures. Jacobs says the launch on September 4 went smoothly, and the giant BU telescope \"swung over and got it, and we followed the thing.\"\nJacobs says they followed the missile through its launch stages until they heard their camera run out of film. He and his team did not witness anything unusual during the filming. The BU telescope was connected to a kinescope for recording, meaning they were not watching the test through that telescope.\n\"We sent the film on down to Vandenberg,\" Jacobs explained, \"and I don't know exactly how long it was after the event; it might have been a day or two, I was called into [USAF Major Florenz J.] Mansmann's office at the first strategic division's aerospace headquarters.\"\nJacobs says he entered the major's office where he saw Mansmann and two unnamed men in grey suits, something he later described as \"very unusual.\" A film screen and a 16mm film projector were set up, and Mansmann asked Jacobs to sit on a couch. The major played the film, which depicted the launch that Jacobs and his team had filmed a day or two earlier, and he was struck at the high quality of the imagery produced by the BU telescope.\n\"Into the fame came something else,\" recalled Jacobs. \"It flew into the frame like this (motions with his hands), and it shot a beam of light at the warhead.\" Jacobs notes that the missile and the unknown object were flying at \"several thousand miles an hour,\" a figure he later pegged at between 11,000 mph and 14,000 mph.\n\"So this thing fires a beam of light at the warhead,\" he continues, \"hits it, and then this thing flies up like this (demonstrates the object moving above the missile into its flight path), fires another beam of light, goes around like this (depicts the object moving to the other side of the missile), fires another beam of light, goes down like this (depicts object below and behind the missile), fires another beam of light, and then flies out the way it came in.\" At this point, the missile tumbled out of its flight path and fell to the ocean below.\nJacobs says at this point, Major Mansmann stopped the film, looked at him, and asked, \"Were you guys screwing around up there?\" Jacobs replied that his team had not altered the film in any way. Jacobs then says he recalls Mansmann asking him, \"what was that?\" He replied, \"It looks to me like we got a UFO.\"\nJacobs says that after Major Mansmann showed him the film, he was told, \"you are never to speak of this again. As far as you're concerned, this never happened.\" Jacobs says Mansmann reminded him of his security oaths and warned of the \"dire consequences\" Jacobs would face if he should share this information. Jacobs claims that as he was leaving, Mansmann suggested that \"years from now if you're ever forced by someone to talk about this, you are to tell them it was laser strikes. Laser tracking strikes.\"\nJacobs says he is not aware of what happened with the film afterward. Mansmann later confirmed Jacobs' story and said he also does not know where the film went.","id":"rec_cp1vddf6gfslia6urd50","latitude":null,"location":"Vandenberg Air Force Base, Big Sur, California","longitude":null,"name":"Vandenberg Air Force Base, Big Sur, California, September, 1964","photos":[],"xata":{"createdAt":"2024-05-14 23:41:41.997119+00","updatedAt":"2024-05-14 23:41:41.997119+00","version":0}},{"date":"2008-01-01 00:00:00+00","description":"On the evening of January 8, 2008, several residents of Stephenville, Texas, reported seeing unusual lights moving quickly through the skies. At approximately 6:15 p.m. witnesses Steve Allen, Mike Odom, and Lance Jones observed a series of flashing lights that they judged to have been at or close to “3,500 feet above ground level,” spanning a region of the sky they estimated to be approximately one square mile. No sounds accompanied these lights, which they said appeared “directly above Highway 67 traveling towards Stephenville at a high rate of speed.”\nAccording to Allen, a private pilot at the time with three decades of flight experience, the lights were traveling at an estimated 3000 miles per hour. He did not recognize them as being similar to any kind of standard lighting associated with aircraft, but instead were “more like strobe lights,” which at one point changed their orientation from a single horizontal line into a pair of vertical rows of lights roughly one-quarter mile apart. Allen said the lights, which were white in color, began to resemble “dirty burning flames” before abruptly disappearing.\nTen minutes later, the lights appeared again, this time with what appeared to be a pair of fighter jets in pursuit. A consistent feature of the January 8 observations had been the silent passage of the lights overhead at what appeared to be tremendous speed. According to Odom, the lights he and the other two men observed were “something not natural; it was moving way too fast.”\nAllen, Odom, and Jones were among the first observers to receive widespread attention for their sighting, following the publication of an article by reporter Angelia Joiner that appeared in the Stephenville Empire-Tribune two days after the incident on January 10, 2008.\nBy the following week, the story had begun to receive national attention from outlets that included the Associated Press. A CNN article published that Monday, January 14, 2008, reported that witnesses now numbering several dozen, “including a pilot, county constable and business owners” had all seen the silent array of lights passing over Stephenville one week beforehand. Several of the witnesses also reported seeing the fighter jets in pursuit of the object, as first reported by witnesses Allen, Odom, and Jones.\nLee Roy Gaitan, a police officer in Stephenville had been walking to his car when he observed, “a red glow that reminded him of pictures he’d seen of an erupting volcano” attached to an object “suspended 3,000 feet in the air.” Gaitan, whose son also observed the hovering object, had been reluctant to come forward with his sighting until he, like other witnesses, read about the sightings in the Empire-Tribune.\nA Mutual UFO Network investigation yielded several conclusions. Among these had been that radar data seemed to corroborate several witness reports of one or more large, unknown objects seen over Stephenville on the evening of January 8. Additionally, some of the radar data obtained by MUFON appeared to indicate that one of these unknown objects had slowly traveled in the direction of Crawford Ranch, the Texas residence of President George W. Bush. The report also noted that there had not been a significant reaction from the military in response to the events, although there had been a number of military aircraft traffic in the area on the evening in question, which in some instances “strayed out of their standard Military Training Routes and into civilian airspace.”\n“It is very difficult to dismiss witness testimony that is corroborated by radar,” the authors wrote in the MUFON report, noting that “radar tracked one of those two objects for over an hour as it traveled directly toward Crawford Ranch. The authors cannot comment on the source or origin of this object, but it is clear to the authors that the unknown object was real and not imaginary.”","id":"rec_cp1vddn6gfslia6urd5g","latitude":null,"location":"Unknown","longitude":null,"name":"Stephenville, Texas, January 8, 2008","photos":[],"xata":{"createdAt":"2024-05-14 23:41:42.010586+00","updatedAt":"2024-05-14 23:41:42.010586+00","version":0}},{"date":"1954-01-01 00:00:00+00","description":"One of the biggest UAP sightings in Italian history took place during a soccer match in Tuscany in front of 10,000 people at Stadio Artemio Franchi in 1954.

The incident is widely regarded as one of the best UAP close encounters ever documented and was logged among the many unidentified cases investigated by the United States Air Force’s Project Blue Book. A brief report on the incident was issued by the Air Force on June 8, 1964. Although stating that Project Blue Book’s investigation was still open at the time the report was issued, it presented several preliminary conclusions. Among these had been that there were no additional witnesses to the event and that no unidentified helicopters or other aircraft were determined to have been in the area at the time. There were also no instances where radar detections of unusual objects had been logged, nor any meteorological activity in the area at the time that might account for what Zamora observed. The report also stated that “no foreign material or radiation above normal for the surrounding area” was found from lab analysis of soil samples collected at the landing site, nor anything indicating a means of propulsion. “There was no evidence presented that the object was extraterrestrial in origin or represented a threat to the security of the United States,” the report added. Newspaper headline featuring Zamora alongside T/Sgt. David Moody (USAF/Project Blue Book).\nThe Air Force also made inquiries about the possibility that Zamora had witnessed part of a test involving a lunar landing module. “Fifteen letters were written to industrial companies asking them for their research status on lunar landing modules,” read the report, which added that such inquiries “had not been useful” in determining what Zamora saw, but that investigators believed “tenant organizations at Holloman hold key to sighting.”¹⁴ However, no conclusive evidence linking the incident to a test vehicle of any kind ever surfaced. Hector Quintanilla, director of Project Blue Book at the time of the incident, initially implied in a statement that the object had been some variety of experimental U.S. aircraft. However, in the absence of any evidence to support this assertion, the Socorro incident was later simply designated one of the many “Unidentified” cases in Project Blue Book’s investigations. Quintanilla, writing for the CIA journal Studies in Intelligence in 1966, went on to call Zamora’s observation “the best-documented case on record,” adding that “we have been unable, in spite of thorough investigation, to find the vehicle or other stimulus that scared Zamora to the point of panic.” In a 1975 memoir of his years with Project Blue Book, Quintanilla expressed dissatisfaction over the way UFO proponents interpreted the Socorro incident’s classification at the time. “Although I labeled the case ‘Unidentified’ I've never been satisfied with that classification,” Quintanilla wrote. “I've always felt that too many essential elements of the case were missing.

The UAP then re-crossed the airport’s runway on its way out to sea, again heading north.\nThere was no squawking transponder signal to alert the airport tower, nor was there any communication with the tower to prevent danger to arriving and departing aircraft from the airport. The pilot of an airborne U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) aircraft claimed to have seen a pinkish to reddish light over the ocean, northwest of the airport, through his left window. According to the pilot, the light was moving towards the airport and he believed it to be higher than his own aircraft, which was around 1600 to 2100 feet.\nThe pilot confirmed visual contact with tower personnel, who also confirmed visual contact. As the object approached the shore, its light “went out.” At that moment, the pilot requested monitoring of the craft with the on-board surveillance equipment. The aircraft’s on-board radar equipment did not detect the object, according to the pilot, but its thermal imaging equipment (FLIR) did. Whilst being seen through the thermal imaging equipment, the pilot did not have visual contact with the UAP. The pilot also confirmed that no attempt was made to intercept the UAP, nor did the object seem to react to the CBP aircraft.\nAnother witness, whose identity is not known, claimed that the UAP caused the delay of commercial aircraft from the airport. This witness also said that the thermal infrared video showing the UAP was widespread within a CBP office. Furthermore, the witness said that United States Air Force (USAF) Intelligence was contacted and provided with a copy of the video. USAF Intelligence, according to the witness, offered no explanation for the UAP and recommended other agencies to contact, whose identities are not known. In the 3 minute 54 second FLIR video, a small object can be seen moving above the ocean and land. Although filmed at night, the object appears to maneuver through residential areas and trees and enters the Atlantic Ocean (without slowing down) before splitting into two separate objects.\nAn investigation by the Scientific Coalition for UAP Studies (SCU) concluded the UAP to be of unknown origin, adding that ‘there is no explanation for an object capable of traveling under water at over 90 mph with minimal impact as it enters the water, through the air at 120 mph at low altitude through a residential area without navigational lights, and finally to be capable of splitting into two separate objects.","id":"rec_cp1vddb4f9p514bqa5mg","latitude":null,"location":"Unknown","longitude":null,"name":"Aguadilla, Puerto Rico, April 25, 2013","photos":[{"attributes":{"height":237,"width":300},"enablePublicUrl":false,"id":"qe55gcio7151h6ie405cfjot8g","mediaType":"image/png","name":"Aguadilla_Puerto_Rico_April_25_2013.png","signedUrlTimeout":600,"size":23714,"storageKey":"ctehkoifn13ah0lj5qdsdklrnc","uploadKey":"cp1vf976gfslia6urd6g","uploadUrlTimeout":86400,"version":0}],"xata":{"createdAt":"2024-05-14 23:41:41.990937+00","updatedAt":"2024-05-14 23:45:40.904624+00","version":1}},{"date":"1896-11-17 06:00:00+00","description":"Newspapers across California, and later other states, especially\nthe Midwest, printed reports of strange airships and lights.\nCommon elements of the descriptions included bright lights,\ncigar-shaped bodies, wings and metallic hull.
