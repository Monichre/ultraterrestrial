Spanning from March 1952 to the end of 1969, Blue Book was the third such effort, succeeding Project Sign (1947-1948) and Project Grudge (1948-1951). While studying a total of 12,618 UFO reports during its tenure, Blue Book survived a number of iterations and leaders before culminating in 1968 with an analysis by Dr. Edward Condon of the University of Colorado.\n\nFrom 1947 to 1969, a total of 12, 618 sightings were reported to Project BLUE BOOK. Of these 701 remain \"Unidentified.\" The project was headquartered at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, whose personnel no longer receive, document or investigate UFO reports.\n\nThe decision to discontinue UFO investigations was based on an evaluation of a report prepared by the University of Colorado entitled, \"Scientific Study of Unidentified Flying Objects;\" a review of the University of Colorado's report by the National Academy of Sciences; past UFO studies and Air Force experience investigating UFO reports during the 40s, '50s, and '60s.\n\nAs a result of these investigations and studies and experience gained from investigating UFO reports since 1948, the conclusions of Project BLUE BOOK are:(1) no UFO reported, investigated, and evaluated by the Air Force has ever given any indication of threat to our national security;(2) there has been no evidence submitted to or discovered by the Air Force that sightings categorized as \"unidentified\" represent technological developments or principles beyond the range of present-day scientific knowledge; and(3) there has been no evidence indicating that sightings categorized as \"unidentified\" are extraterrestrial vehicles.\n\nWith the termination of Project BLUE BOOK, the Air Force regulations establishing and controlling the program for investigating and analyzing UFOs were rescinded. Documentation regarding the former BLUE BOOK investigation has been permanently transferred to the Military Reference Branch, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington, DC 20408, and is available for public review and analysis.\n\nSince Project BLUE BOOK was closed, nothing has happened to indicate that the Air Force ought to resume investigating UFOS. Because of the considerable cost to the Air Force in the past, and the tight funding of Air Force needs today, there is no likelihood the Air Force will become involved with UFO investigation again.\n\nThere are a number of universities and professional scientific organizations, such as the American Association for the Advancement of Science, which have considered UFO phenomena during periodic meetings and seminars. In addition, a list of private organizations interested in aerial phenomena my be found in Gayle's Encyclopedia of Associations (edition 8, vol-. 1, pp. 432-433). Such timely review of the situation by private groups ensures that sound evidence will not be overlooked by the scientific community.\n\nA person calling the base to report a UFO is advised to contact a private or professional organization (as mentioned above) or to contact a local law enforcement agency if the caller feels his or public safety is endangered.\n\nPeriodically, it is erroneously stated that the remains of extraterrestrial visitors are or have been stored at Wright-Patterson AFB. There are not now nor ever have been, any extraterrestrial visitors or equipment on Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.","id":"rec_cobdhj5bjt595h6377n0","name":"Project Blue Book","photo":"c9d78955-27af-4454-80e0-c0a7e395b97c.jpeg (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/27/27/1712786400000/O5qutkYqn-j_vvH3zpfGqA/wQ_HP-C8roGndTbhsQx0BKaVwcNS5KFpdYLgueHMmb7azijPcN5vk8QPq0ErWmdjAPOmebrmQzYb7QvqfxT8QAkcQOm4gGOapqyVro1Alp5-jOIeKJQ7FvU1yIELyfpcxs6mCvnbiNHl0tmNBO9oXg/gwnjytkeCPFj_CZ6-fE2KONpO0kftuMpz3rkSJCroqc)","specialization":null,"xata":{"createdAt":"2024-04-10 18:22:04.499254+00","updatedAt":"2024-04-10 18:22:04.499254+00","version":0}},{"description":"In 2007, U.S. Senator Harry Reid and two other influential senators covertly secured $22 million for the Department of Defense (DoD) to study UAP through what became known as the Advanced Aeronautics Weapons System Application Program, or AAWSAP.
