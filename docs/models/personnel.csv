"Tom DeLonge is a former member of the band Blink-182 and co-founder of To The Stars Academy of Arts & Science, focusing on UFO research.
This, DeLonge explained, ties into his belief that the U.S. government has exercised caution in revealing information about UFOs over the decades as a means to protect the public.

""I think in the beginning, it was probably a lot of fear,"" he said of the government's purported silence. ""You're dealing with World War II barely [being] over... We started having crashes. We had fighting through the war, but things started crashing and they're finding vehicles and they're finding occupants, and they don't know what it is. They're like, 'Where are these coming from?'

""They probably thought it was one particular thing. And then they start you digging into people's encounters and people are having contact and then not all the stories are good and people are getting hurt, and things are changing.

Goldie Hawn reveals alien encounter: ""They touched my face""READ MOREGoldie Hawn reveals alien encounter: ""They touched my face""
""And they're looking into our mind and into our DNA, and then finding out over time, maybe these things aren't coming from other planets, these crafts seem to be doing things in the air, that has to do with frequency. And then there's understanding, you know, the universe, the world around us over decades, and we go, 'Oh, my God, these things might be coming through time.'

""It's just like, every time we find something out, it's so much bigger and more complex, and potentially damaging to us in various ways.""

While DeLonge's statements could be dismissed as wild musings, he was somewhat vindicated back in July, after claims were espoused in a special hearing that alien life not only exists but has traveled to Earth, with specimens held by the U.S. government. Research by his To The Stars Academy was also cited.

In a session of the House Oversight Committee, part of an investigation of claims regarding UFOs, witnesses testified that the government had been aware of non-human activity since the 1930s.

""The UFO Hearings today made history,"" DeLonge wrote in an Instagram post at the time. ""I am so proud of the three witnesses today that blew the lid off the UFO secrecy that has been intact for decades.""",,https://www.facebook.com/officialtomdelonge,rec_cobdfd4jmvif9dabl1o0,@tomdelonge,Tom DeLonge,,Screenshot 2024-04-10 at 11.53.36 AM.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/27/27/1712779200000/xSZXz0uO3IvnaRbVvwyPqw/5f7BjLsqmznYG5nwtwsK5S62rUQ7M5DoNE5PxExdWvvcX4Ts0YBQ47v4vPBOZJqZ_uUtZGEm740qe4Gf3X9d1wd2D1NZbX30nb_bajNwjlWYC-Vf68XTEMLD2lVnAzcHGxIiLteulV5UVFwnaJBDHaEuLg0X0e5Hu3g2Ce_1Adw0sWfInHrEQv1_VAe6OjZh/y1yQn85QFGkVPV9ItaaespgSV4lpK8gOV3odyNveyuI),,7,"Musician, To The Stars Academy Founder",@tomdelonge,https://www.tothestarsacademy.com,,,,,,,,,,,,

"David Grusch is a decorated combat veteran and former intelligence officer for the USAF, who has come into the spotlight for his allegations regarding the U.S. government's involvement in UFO retrieval programs. According to Grusch, the government possesses spacecraft of non-human origin and has been involved in reverse-engineering these crafts as well as handling extraterrestrial biological materials. His claims include encounters with dead pilots within these unidentified crafts, suggesting a far more extensive government knowledge and interaction with extraterrestrial technology than previously disclosed【31†source】【33†source】.

Grusch's military career is notable for his service in Afghanistan, where he provided crucial intelligence on high-ranking Taliban officials, significantly aiding U.S. and NATO forces. Post-military, he played a significant role in the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and the National Reconnaissance Office, focusing on UAP/UFO sightings and incidents【32†source】.

Despite the explosive nature of his disclosures, the U.S. government, including the Pentagon and NASA, has denied finding any verifiable information to support Grusch's claims regarding the possession or reverse-engineering of extraterrestrial materials. The debate around Grusch's allegations underscores the ongoing controversy and fascination with UFOs and extraterrestrial life, highlighting the conflict between whistleblower testimonies and official government statement

Robert Bigelow is a billionaire entrepreneur with a keen interest in space exploration and UFO research, funding various projects in the field. Bigelow has been a long-time believer in UFOs and has provided significant financial support for investigations and research into UFOs and paranormal/parapsychological topics. 
In the mid-1990s, Bigelow founded the National Institute for Discovery Science (NIDS), an organization dedicated to studying unexplained phenomena, including UFOs. NIDS operated until 2004. 
In 1996, Bigelow purchased the Skinwalker Ranch in Utah, which had a reputation as a ""paranormal hotspot"". NIDS conducted research and investigations at the ranch for several years. 
In 2007, Bigelow's company Bigelow Aerospace received a $22 million contract from the U.S. Department of Defense to study advanced aerospace threats, including UFOs. This was part of a secret Pentagon program called the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program. 
Bigelow also collaborated with the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON) for a period, providing funding so they could investigate UFO reports more quickly and thoroughly. 
More recently, Bigelow has shifted some of his focus towards researching the possibility of life after death. In 2021, his institute offered a $1 million prize for essays arguing for the existence of consciousness after death. 
Bigelow has stated that he believes UFOs are real and that they could be present among the human population in some form, whether as extraterrestrial visitors or hybrids. He has said he is more interested in the ""presence"" of UFOs than just the ""hardware"" aspects.

Used hypnosis to help draw out and investigate these abduction claims, which drew criticism from some in the scientific community.
Believed the abduction accounts were authentic and represented a real phenomenon, despite lack of physical evidence.
