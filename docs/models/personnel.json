We started having crashes. We had fighting through the war, but things started crashing and they're finding vehicles and they're finding occupants, and they don't know what it is. They're like, 'Where are these coming from?'\n\n\"They probably thought it was one particular thing.

And then there's understanding, you know, the universe, the world around us over decades, and we go, 'Oh, my God, these things might be coming through time.'\n\n\"It's just like, every time we find something out, it's so much bigger and more complex, and potentially damaging to us in various ways.\"\n\nWhile DeLonge's statements could be dismissed as wild musings, he was somewhat vindicated back in July, after claims were espoused in a special hearing that alien life not only exists but has traveled to Earth, with specimens held by the U.S. government. Research by his To The Stars Academy was also cited.\n\nIn a session of the House Oversight Committee, part of an investigation of claims regarding UFOs, witnesses testified that the government had been aware of non-human activity since the 1930s.\n\n\"The UFO Hearings today made history,\" DeLonge wrote in an Instagram post at the time. \"I am so proud of the three witnesses today that blew the lid off the UFO secrecy that has been intact for decades.\"","credibility":null,"facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/officialtomdelonge","id":"rec_cobdfd4jmvif9dabl1o0","instagram":"@tomdelonge","name":"Tom

Bigelow has been a long-time believer in UFOs and has provided significant financial support for investigations and research into UFOs and paranormal/parapsychological topics. \nIn the mid-1990s, Bigelow founded the National Institute for Discovery Science (NIDS), an organization dedicated to studying unexplained phenomena, including UFOs. NIDS operated until 2004. \nIn 1996, Bigelow purchased the Skinwalker Ranch in Utah, which had a reputation as a \"paranormal hotspot\". NIDS conducted research and investigations at the ranch for several years. \nIn 2007, Bigelow's company Bigelow Aerospace received a $22 million contract from the U.S. Department of Defense to study advanced aerospace threats, including UFOs. This was part of a secret Pentagon program called the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program. \nBigelow also collaborated with the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON) for a period, providing funding so they could investigate UFO reports more quickly and thoroughly. \nMore recently, Bigelow has shifted some of his focus towards researching the possibility of life after death. In 2021, his institute offered a $1 million prize for essays arguing for the existence of consciousness after death. \nBigelow has stated that he believes UFOs are real and that they could be present among the human population in some form, whether as extraterrestrial visitors or hybrids. He has said he is more interested in the \"presence\" of UFOs than just the \"hardware\" aspects.
