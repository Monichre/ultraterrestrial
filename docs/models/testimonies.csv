The document describing a secret government committee, Majestic 12, making a treaty with Gray aliens, only to later realize they've been deceived by the aliens.[27][28]

The Statement claims a UFO coverup has been underway for 40 years. Lear argues that ""Germany may have recovered a flying saucer in 1939"" and discusses the 1946 American military investigation into the Ghost rockets reported over Sweden. The Statement argues that many in the ""original group"" of insiders committed suicide, most notably James Forrestal. According to the narrative, Truman formed a group of twelve insiders, known as Majestic 12, to investigate the matter. The Statement lists three saucer crashes: one near Roswell. another near Aztec, New Mexico and a third near Laredo, Texas. According to the Statement, the US government covered a ""total, thorough and sweeping cover-up to include the use of 'deadly force'.""

The Statement references the 1952 Washington, D.C., UFO incident and a 1964 meeting with aliens at Holloman Air Force Base. Lear's Statement includes government-sanctioned alien abductions, alien implants, and Alien-Human hybrids. The Statement asserts that ""some of the nations missing children had been used for secretions and other parts required by the aliens"". Lear described UFOs in connect with cattle mutilations and even claims that human mutilations have occurred. Lear talks about Dulce Base and an altercation between aliens and the US military that led to 66 human casualties.

Lear's statement influenced Thomas Allen LeVesque, pen name ""Jason Bishop III"", who later admitted to fabricating stories about Dulce Base. [29][30]",rec_cobdfd4jmvif9dabl17g,,,,,,,,,,

There were many explanations of what that could be, other than another spacecraft from another country or another world - it was either the rocket we had separated from, or the 4 panels that moved away when we extracted the lander from the rocket and we were nose to nose with the two spacecraft. So in the close vicinity, moving away, were 4 panels. And I feel absolutely convinced that we were looking at the sun reflected off of one of these panels. Which one? I don't know. So technically, the definition could be 'unidentified.'""",rec_cokjn8kuttukesrsanu0,,,,,,,,,,
