He also claimed to have read government documents detailing alien involvement in human affairs over the past 10,000 years.

In December 2015 it was recognized as one of four new elements by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) and the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP), and was officially named moscovium in November 2016 after the Moscow Oblast, where JINR is located. Moscovium is extremely radioactive. its most stable known isotope, moscovium-290, has a half-life of only 0.65 seconds. The element gained a significant amount of attention in the realm of UFO conspiracy theories and science fiction due to claims by Bob Lazar, who in the late 1980s claimed to have worked at a secret site called S-4 (near Area 51). Lazar alleged that he worked on reverse-engineering extraterrestrial technology and that moscovium was used as fuel for the propulsion of alien spacecraft, due to its purported ability to produce anti-gravity effects when bombarded with protons. However, these claims are not supported by any scientific evidence and are considered to be part of UFO mythology and lore."

This method, widely used in software engineering, mechanical engineering, and electronic engineering, serves various purposes, including understanding how a product works, repurposing obsolete technology, conducting security analysis, and learning from or competing with other designs. While the primary focus here is on technological aspects, the concept intriguingly applies to the notion of reverse engineering alien technology, an idea often explored in science fiction and speculative discussions. This involves studying extraterrestrial artifacts or systems to understand their advanced technology, potentially leading to significant breakthroughs in human technology."
