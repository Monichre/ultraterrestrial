Views allow you to encapsulate the details of the structure of your tables.

Simple `view` usage:

```sql
create or replace view user_view
  as select name, email from user
```

More usage: Joint table using `view`

```sql
create or replace view my_view
  as select name, date, location
    from weather, cities
    where city == name;
```
