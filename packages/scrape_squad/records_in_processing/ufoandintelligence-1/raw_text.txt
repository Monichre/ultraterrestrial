UFOs  and Intelligence: A Timeline  
November 18, 2024 
Aggregation by George M. Eberhart ©202 4 
 
After an effort of many years, I have prepared a comprehensive timeline of UFO history that will be useful to UFO 
researchers and historians. “UFOs and Intelligence” is an up -to-date retrospective of UFO history (from the airship of 
Clonmacnoise to the newly appointed US investigation agency All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office ), intertwined with 
events in US and world history concerning military and civilian intelligence agencies and the cult of secrecy . It is now 
more than 1,000 pages and more than 900,000 words (including a substantial “Sources and Further Reading” appendix). 
Readers will disco ver or rediscover many events, people, and UFO cases they may not be familiar with. Some will find it 
useful for current or planned research projects. Military cases, those involving commercial aircraft, close encounters 
involving physical traces and other evidence, reports involving occupants or entities, and events surrounding  military and 
sensitive nuclear sites are emphasized, but this timeline covers the full spectrum of UFO history, from contactee  
experiences  to misidentifications of mundane phenomena  and notorious hoaxes. Links to online sources are given, and 
links to biographical information are provided when available. A timeline like this allows us to view events from a 
different perspective, letting us make connections we might not otherwise see. It forces us to view the big picture, amid 
the grand flow of UFO cases, military security decisions, a vast swathe of personalities, and world history.  As of 2022, all 
references have proper bibliographical citations with  embedded links ; if you have a version with  raw URL links,  it is an 
earlier version . Dead links  will be repaired as quickly as possible.  A special note of thanks to Jeff Knox, a UFO 
researcher in Oregon who has been helping me improve this document with corrections, additions, and amplifications.  
 
743  
 
743 (or 744 or 748)  — Ships with men aboard are seen in the air over Ireland, according to entries in the Annals of Ulster,  
the Annals of Tigernach,  the Annals of Clonmacnoise,  the Annals of the Four Masters,  and some manuscripts of 
Lebar Gabála.  Later accounts through the Middle Ages progressively expand on this with picturesque details. 
First the ships are reduced to one ship over Teltown , County Meath,  from which a crewman thr ows and then 
recover s a fishing -spear. Then the scene shift s to the abbey of Cl onmacnoise  in County Offaly , and later to 
Britain, and the fishing -spear is changed to an anchor that snags on some feature of a church. The sailor who 
climb s down to release it is also said to be in danger of drowning in the thicker air of this lower world.  The event 
is variously interpreted as unusual cloud formations, an aurora borealis , an ocean mirage, or UFOs. (Wikipedia,

1856, pp. 2 –3; Kuno Meyer, “ The Irish Mirabilia in the Norse ‘Speculum Regale, ’” Ériu 4 (1910): 1 –16; John

812 
 
812 — Agobard , the archbishop of Lyon, France, writes De Grandine et Tonitruis  (“On Hail and Thunder”), in which he 
condemns pagan folk beliefs, such as the notion of a “certain region called Magonia, from which ships, navigating 
on clouds, set sail to transport back to this same region the fruits of the earth ruined by hail and des troyed by the 
storm.”  He cites an episode in which some foolish peasants capture “three men and one woman who they said had 
fallen from these ships.” Brought out in front of an enraged mob, Agobard intervenes and prevents their lynching, 
persuading the crowd  that the charges are false and absurd.  Some ufologists interpret this as a visitation from an 
alternate reality or an abduction case, while Jean -Louis Brodu observes that in the 9 th century the atmosphere  was 
likened to an ocean in which aerial ships could navigate from point to point o n the earth. Miceal Ross argues that 
Magonia  is a corruption of Magonianus,  relating to the city of Mahón, the port of the i sland of Menorca, Spain.

1060  
 
1060  (approximately) — A large luminous object (a “pearl”) begins to appear near Yangzhou, China, for a period of 10 
years. At first it is seen in a swamp, then it changes location to two different lakes. A friend of the author sees it 
one night when it opens a door so that light shoots out from the crack “like a golden ray.” The door opens further, 
revealin g a bright, silvery light inside, so much so that the trees are illuminated as if by a sunrise. Suddenly it 
takes off through the air and over the water, “shining like the sun.”  It appears so frequently that the location 
attracts regular tourists, but it s tops appearing and people search for it in vain. (Shen Kuo, “ Brush Talks from 
Dream Book, ” in The Columbia Anthology of Traditional Chinese Literature,  Columbia University, 1994, p. 593)  
 
1252  
 
1252  — A bright globe of light nearly as large as the moon is seen above Padua, Italy , for one hour before vanishing.  It 
moves faster than the moon, just as fast as a falling star. (Rolandino of Padua, Cronica in Factis circa Facta 
Marchiae Trivixane,  a cura di Antonio Bonardi, in Raccolta degli Storici Italiani…ordinat a da L. A. Muratori,

1290  — October 28. The story of a large silver disk seen in the sky over Byland Abbey, in North Yorkshire, England, is a 
hoax perpetrated by two British teenagers in 1953. ( [Letter], London Times,  January 9, 1953; Desmond Leslie and

1440  — Nicholas of Cusa  publishes On Learned Ignorance,  in which he advocates not only the idea of a plurality of 
worlds but also the existence of life on the moon and sun.  (Wikipedia, “ De Docta Ignorantia ”) 
 
1457  
 
1457 — French theologian William Vorilong  agrees that God could create another inhabited world, but adds that Jesus of 
Nazareth  only redeemed this world. God would have to address the issue of sin in other worlds on an individual 
basis.  (David Darling, “ Encyclopedia ”) 
 
1461  
 
1461, November 1  — Night. A bright object like a long and thick iron bar is seen in the vicinity of Arras, France. It 
appears as bright as the full moon and remains visible for about 7 minutes, apparently moving in a spiral.

 1492  
 
1492, October 11  — 10:00 p.m. Standing on the deck of the Santa María,  Christopher Columbus  sees a light in the 
distance “like a small wax candle that rose and lifted up.” Another sailor also sees the faint light . Columbus 
considers it an indication of land, and he indeed makes landfall on San Salvador Island, or one of the other islands 
in the Bahama s, about four hours later. Historians attribute the light to canoes, fires onshore, or bioluminescence.

1532  
 
1532  — Juan Maldonaldo , a Spanish cleric, writes Somnium,  in which he travels to the Moon in a dream. There he is 
taken to a lunar city, whose houses around the square are identical and symmetrical. The building is exceptional, 
with fine materials which remind him of the New Jerusalem. T he temple ’s central location and its wonderful 
execution stand out. The inhabitants play, dance, and bathe in a lake in the center of the city. They are all equal 
and treat each other with respect. He finally comes back to the Earth, to a city in America, where he talks to locals 
who are Christians.  (“Utopian Texts ”; Daniel Garcia Valdes, “ Somnium, de Juan Maldonaldo: ¿Primera novela de 
ciencia ficción de la historia ?” La Soga , Revista Cultural, January 13, 2020 ) 
 
1547  
 
1547, December  15 — Mariners in the port of Hamburg, Germany, see a fireball moving to the south. Its rays are so hot 
that passengers cannot remain inside the ships. Thinking the vessels are about to burn, they hide and take cover.

1561  
 
1561, April 14 — Dusk. A “frightening vision” is seen in the sky above Nuremberg, Germany, said to be observed by 
many. Printer Hans Glaser  describes in his broadside many blood -red, blue, and black balls or discs near the Sun. 
“They were three alongside each other, sometimes four in a square, and several alone, and between these balls  
blood -colored crosses” are seen. Two “great pipes” (cannon) are also observed, and everything starts to “fight 
against each other.” The battle lasts about one hour, then the burning balls fall to the earth and vanish on the 
ground. Although cited as a pos sible early UFO report, the narrative is simply about a battle in the sky by 
phantom armies told as an allegory of what awaits an unrepentant humanity on Judgment Day.  A meteorological 
cause is also possible.  (“Nürnberger Flugblatt von 1561, ” Wikipedia; Hans Glaser, Himmelserscheinung über

1566  
 
1566, July 27 –28, August  7 — Sunrise. In Basel, Switzerland, numerous large black balls are said to have been seen 
passing around the sun, apparently engaged in a fight. Many turn red and are extinguished. Ulrich Magin  suggests 
that the description is an apocryphal sky battle that is a warning sign from God. ( “Basler Flugblatt von 1566, ”

 1584  
 
1584  — Italian philosopher Giordano Bruno  introduces in his De l’infinito , universo e mondi  the idea of multiple worlds 
supporting the infinite possibilities of a pristine, indivisible One. His character Philotheo claims that “innumerable 
celestial bodies, stars, globes, suns, and earths may be sensibly perceived therein by us and an infinite nu mber of 
them may be inferred by our own reason.”  (Wikipedia, “ De l’infinito, universe e mondi ”; Giordano Bruno, De

1608  
 
1608  — German astronomer Johannes Kepler  writes Somnium  to describe what practicing astronomy would be like from 
the perspective of another planet  and to show the feasibility of a non -geocentric system. The manuscript, which 
disappear s after changing hands several times, describe s a fantastic trip to the Moon; it is part allegory, part 
autobiography, and part treatise on interplanetary travel , and is sometimes described as the first work of science 
fiction . It is published posthumously by his son, Ludwig Kepler.  (Wikipedia, “ Somnium  (novel) ”; Johannes 
Kepler, Somnium, seu opus posthumum De astronomia lunari,  Frankfurt, 1634)  
 
1627  
 
1627  — English bishop Francis Godwin  writes The Man in the Moone , describing a Spaniard named Gonsales who flies 
to the Moon (with the help of some swans) and visits people there who are Christians living in a utopian society.  
The Lunars speak a language consisting “not so much of words and letters as tunes and strange sounds,” which 
Gonsales succeeds in gaining some fluency in after a couple of months. He discovers that their unruly children are 
swapped out for better -behaved k ids on Earth.  (Wikipedia, “ The Man in the Moone ”) 
 
1630  
 
1630, January 25  — 7:00 p.m. German astronomer Wilhelm Schickard  observes a bright -white oval or egg -shaped object 
in the northern sky above Tübingen, Germany. The object is later joined by two other white shapes, although in 
differing stages of intensity. One looks like an “overturned cauldron,” while the other is sim ilar to a “long 
whetstone ground down on both sides.” The cloud -like objects do not flicker like stars but seem to fade in and out 
of visibility. Colored lights also appear around the original object over a period of three hours . (Wilhelm

1632  
 
1632  — Italian astronomer Galileo Gal ilei writes in Dialogue Concerning  the Two Chief World Systems  that if life exists

1638  
 
1638  — English c lergyman an d philosopher John Wilkins  writes The Discovery of a World in the Moone,  in which he 
highlights the similarities of the Earth and the Moon (seas, mountains, atmosphere) and concludes that the Moon 
is likely to be i nhabited by living beings, whom the calls “Selenites.” (John Wilkins, The Discovery of a World in 
the Moone , 1638 ; Maria Avxentevskaya, “ How 17th Century Dreamers Planned to Reach the Moon, ” Real Clear 
Science, Decem ber 2, 2017)  1638  — Night. John Everett and two companions are crossing the Muddy River near Boston, Massachusetts, in a boat 
when a “great light” appears above them. It darts back and forth across the river, sometimes hovering and 
“flaming up,” for about 2 –3 hours. After they stop watching it, they discover that their boat  has moved about one 
mile against the current to the place where they had embarked. ( John Winthrop , The History of New England from 
1630 to 1649,  Little, Brown, 1853, vol. 1, pp. 349 –350)

1663  
 
1663, August 1 5 — 12:00 noon . The faithful gathered in a church in a village near Lake Zarobozero, Vologda Oblast, 
Russia, hear a  loud noise outside and see a l arge ball of fire descend from the north and then head south following 
the lake, low over its surface. The fireball seems to measure about 140 feet across and has blue smoke issuing 
from its sides. Two fiery rays extend from its front part. Less than an hour later, a similar fireba ll reappears over 
the same lake. Moving from south to west, the object again disappears. It reappears a third time a short while 
later, this time  larger than before, and stays over the lake for an hour and a half. Peasants in a bo at try to get close 
to it, but the heat is to o intense. The water of the lake is illuminated to a depth of 30 feet, and fish are seen 
swimming away from the object , which  then flies off to the west. ( Akty istoricheskie, sobranye i izdanye

of birds, fire, and smoke, as well as a dark “ round flat form  like a plate and like a big man ’s hat” that hovers 
above St. Nicholas Church for one hour. Witnesses include several fishermen who later complain of tremors in 
their hands and feet. ( Eine abgebildete Beschreibung von dem wunderbarlichen Stralsundischen Lufft -Kriege und

1686  
 
1686  — French philosopher Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle  writes Conversations on the Plurali ty of Worlds,  in which he 
expresses the idea that the stars are distant suns that might have their own planetary systems, including the possibility of extraterrestrial life . He imagines Venusians to be “little black people, scorched with the Sun, full of 
fire, very amorous.” ( Wikipedia, “ Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds ”)  
 
1698  
 
1698  — Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens  has a work posthumously published,  Cosmotheoros (or, in its English title  
Celestial Worlds Discover’d: Or, Conjectures Concerning the Inhabitants, Plants and Productions of the Worlds 
in the Planets)  that will within two decades be available in five languages beyond its original Latin version.  He 
speculates that other planets also harbor plant and animal life. (Christiaan Huygens, Celestial Worlds Discover’d,  
1722)  
 
1737  
 
1737, December 5  — 5:00 p.m . Physician Thomas Short  witnesses a blood -red luminous display in the sky around 
Sheffield, England, which moves from west to north and then to  the east. The cause seems to be one or more 
clouds in which are embedded brilliant lights as bright as the full moon that give off slow -moving streamers or 
rays. The display is accompanied by unseasonable heat and lasts until 10:30 p.m. Short hears that a sim ilar 
phenomenon is seen at the same time in Venice, Italy, and Kilkenny, Ireland, where it appear s as a bursting 
fireball. (Thomas Short, “ An Account of Several Meteors, ” Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society  41 
(1741): 625 –627) 
1737, December 6 — Afternoon. A large, blood -red object is seen in the western sky at Bucharest, Wallachia [now 
Romania]. It lingers for two hours before splitting up then reuniting once again.  The phenomenon is said to have 
occurred at night in the Banat region.  (Hobana and Weverbergh 222 ; Romania 4 ) 
 
1741  
 
1741, September 21 — Dawn. Parson -naturalist Gilbert White  wakes up at his vicarage in Selborne, Hampshire, England , 
and finds the neighboring clover fields matted all over with a thick coat of cobwebs, laced with dew. The dogs are 
blinded by it when they attempt to hunt. At 9:00 a.m. more cobwebs fall from the sky and continue until dusk. 
They are “perfect flakes or rags; some near an inch broad, and five or six long, which fell with a degree of  
velocity that showed they were considerably heavier than the atmosphere.”  The fall extends to the neighboring 
villages of New Alresford and Bradley. (Gilbert White, The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne , 1789, 
Letter XXIII ) 
 
1742  
 
1742, December 16? — 8:40 p.m. Physician Cromwell Mortimer , secretary of the Royal Society, is walking through St. 
James ’s Park in Westminster, London, England , when he sees a light ascend from behind the trees and houses in 
the southwest. When it reaches 20° against the sky , it takes a horizontal path with an undulating motion before 
disappearing in the north east after a full 30 seconds. The front part is luminous with a frame -like structure behind 
it, and it has a faint trail.  The date is questionable since Mortimer calls this a “Thursday” and December 16 was a 
Sunday . ([A Note by Cromwell Mortimer ], Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society  43 (1745): 524–525) 
 
1745  
 
1745, July 14 — Astronomer George Costard  observes a meteoric stream of fire  whose trail persist s for at least one hour

water, head directly toward them from the northeast and explode some 150 feet away from the ship, causing some 
damage to the mast, before it continues on toward the south west. The incident takes place in the North Atlantic 
Ocean some 240 miles west of Cape Finisterre, Spain. (Chalmers, “ An Account of an Extraordinary Fireball

1755  
 
1755, March  — German philosopher Immanuel Kant  publishes Universal Natural History and Theory of the Heavens,  in 
which he theorizes that distance from the Sun determines the intelligence level of a world ’s inhabitants; thus, the 
people who live on Mercury are the stupidest, and the Venusians are only dimly brighter —making any Jupiterians 
and Saturnians much smar ter than earthlings. (Wikipedia, “ Universal Natural History and Theory of the 
Heavens ”) 
 
1756  
 
1756  — Scottish astronomer James Ferguson  writes Astronomy Explained upon Sir Isaac Newton ’s Principles,  
proclaiming the certainty of a plurality of inhabited worlds “peopled with myriads of intelligent beings, formed

enormous undertaking as the universe cannot have been created for just one race on one planet . (Emanuel 
Swedenborg, The Earths in the Universe , London, 1875 ; Richard Smoley, “ Is There Really Life on Other 
Planets? ” Swedenborg Foundation, February 15, 2019 ) 
 
1759  
 
1759, April 27  — 4:00 p.m. F ollowing a clap of thunder, a flat, pale object is seen “danc ing” in the sky over Longdon, 
Somerset, England . It is joined by three similar objects, all of which move from west to east for 30 seconds and 
disappear in a cloud. (London Universal Chronicle  and Weekly Gazette , May 5, 1759; Chris Aubeck and Martin 
Shough, Return to Magonia: Investigating U FOs in History,  Anomalist, 2015, pp.  83–96) 
 
1762  
 
1762, August 9  — 12:00 noon. An amateur astronomer named de Rostan is observing the Sun at Lausanne, Switzerland, 
when he notices a large, spindle -shaped body moving across the solar dis c from eas t to west at a slower rate of 
speed than sunspots move. It is surrounded by a thin “nebulosity.” An observer named Croste in Solothurn , 
Switzerland, also observes the object, but French astronomer Charles Messier , who is also taking solar 
measurements in Paris , France,  does not see it. It remains visible until September 7, when it passes the Sun ’s 
western limb. (“ Observation Astronomique, ” Histoire de l ’Académie Royale des Sciences,  1766, pp. 106 –107; “An Account of a Very Singular Phaenomenon Seen in the Disk of the Sun, ” Annual Register,  1766 , pp. 120 –122;

course of the River Isla near Coupar Angus, Perth, Scotland . It move s northeast to the confluence of the River 
Ericht and follow s that stream to the west toward Blairgowrie where it disappear s. It is accompanied by strong 
winds that destroy two houses . (Annual Register  1767, pp. 127 –128) 
 
1775  
 
1775  — Louis -Guillaime de Lafolie  writes Le Philosophe sans prétention,  a work of proto -science fiction in which he 
follows a narrator , an Arab named Nadir who, in a vision, beholds the voyages of a Mercurian named Ormisais. In 
his description of life on Mercury, Ormisais relates the workings of an elite scientific -literary organization (like 
the British Royal Society ) but much more restrictive, with only a dozen members. One of the applicants for the 
latest vacancy is a young inventor, Scintilla, the true hero of the tale. He shows the Academy members his flying 
machine, “an elaborate combination of wheels, globes of glass, sprin gs, wires, glass -covered wooden uprights, a 
plate rubbed with camphor and covered with gold leaf .” After a short demonstration flight, Ormisais is chosen to 
take the trip to Earth, but he crash es and is stranded, a stranger in a strange land. He tells Nadir that it took him 
500 hours to ascend or descend to Earth ; the universe, he says , has neither height nor depth nor center nor 
frontiers . (Chris Aubeck, Alien Artifacts, Vo lume 1: From Antiquity to 1880,  The Author, 2022, p. 35)  
 
1777  
 
1777, June 17  — 11:46 a.m. French astronomer Charles Messier  views a large number of round, dark -brown globules 
passing in front of the disc of the sun for 5 minutes from west -southwest to east -northeast.  He sees them through 
an achromatic refractor at the naval observatory located in the Hôtel de Cluny in Paris , France . His estimate of 
their size (one -600th the size of the solar disc) puts them near the limit of resolution for his telescope , but Messier 
claims the objects are far away and in focus.  Martin Shough and Wim van Utrecht conclude, based on the 
telescope Messier used and his observational data, that the globules were “not grossly out -of-focus nearby 
particles ” (in other words an optical artifact) and probably were objects at a distance of several miles or so away. 
What those objects were is impossible to determ ine today.  (Charles Messier, “ Observation singulaire d ’une 
prodigieuse quantité de petits globules qui ont passé devant le disque du soleil, le 17 juin 1777, ” Mémoires de 
l’Academie Royale  des Sciences , 1777, pp. 464 –472; Martin Shough and Wim van Utrecht, Redemption  of the 
Damned,  vol. 1, Anomalist, 2019, pp. 7 –18) 
 
1783  
 
1783  — British astronomer William Herschel  has been observing the lunar surface since the mid -1770s in Bath, England, 
and writes journal entries in which he details sightings of immense trees, forests, and pastures, comparing it to the 
English countryside. By 1778, he is seeing circular formations that he thinks are towns and villages. He also notes 
canals, roads, and pat ches of vegetation, but never writes about it publicly, since he knows that telescopic 
observations can be tricky. ( George Basalla , Civilized Life in the Universe,  Oxford University, 2006 , pp. 51 –52) 
 
1783, August 18 — 9:15–9:30 p.m. An unusually bright bolide is observed in the British Isles on a clear, dry night. 
Analysis indicates that the meteor has entered the Earth ’s atmosphere over the  North Sea , before passing over the 
east coast of  Scotland,  England,  and the  English Channel ; it finally breaks up, after a passage within the 
atmosphere of around 1,000 miles, over southwestern  France  or northern  Italy. Perhaps the most prominent 
witness is  Tiberius Cavallo , an Italian  natural philosopher  who happens to be among a group of people on the 
terrace at  Windsor Castle , Berkshire, England,  at the time the meteor appears. ( Wikipedia, “ 1783 Great Meteor ”; Tiberius Cavallo, “ Description of a Meteor, Observed Aug. 18, 1783 ,” Philosophical Transactions of the Royal

1783, September 19 — The Montgolfier brothers,  Joseph -Michel and Jacques -Étienne, publicly demonstrate their  
Aérostat Réveillon  balloon at Versailles, France, for Louis XVI  and Marie Antoinette . It is flown with the first 
living beings in a basket attached to the balloon: a sheep called Montauciel (“Climb -to-the-sky”), a duck, and a 
rooster. The sheep is believed to have a reasonable approximation of human physiology. The duck is expected to 
be unharmed by being lifted aloft. It is included as a control for effects created by the aircraft rather than the 
altitude. The rooster is included as a further control , as it is a bird that d oes not fly at high altitudes.  The flight 
lasts approximately eight minutes, covers 2 miles, and reaches an altitude of about 1,500 feet. Some 100,000 
people witness the event. The craft lands safely in the woods of Vaucresson,  with the sheep unperturbed, the duck 
upset, and rooster killed with a broken neck.  (Wikipedia, “ Montgolfier brothers ”; The Romance of Ballooning:

1783, November 21 — 1:54 p.m.  The first balloon to carry humans aloft in free flight is launched by the Montgolfier 
brothers  in a public demonstration  at the Château de la Muette in Paris . The aeronauts are Jean-François Pilâtre de 
Rozier  and François Laurent d’Arlandes . They take off, observed by Louis XVI , various members of the court 
and Academy, and Benjamin Franklin . The balloon travels slowly for 25 minutes and 5.5 miles to the southeast, 
attaining a height of 3,000 feet. Burning embers are scorching the balloon fabric and have to be daubed out with 
sponges and Pilâtre’s coat, so even though they have fuel remaining , they return to the ground at Butte -aux-
Cailles between two windmills. Upon landing, the pilots drink champagne.  (Wikip edia, “ Montgolfier brothers ”;

1790  
 
1790, June 12 — 5:00 a.m. Several farmers in Alençon , Normandy, France, see a large globe surrounded by flames  and 
making a whistling sound. The object slow s, oscillat es, and move s toward the top of a hill, unearthing some plants 
along the slope. The heat is so intense that grass and small trees start burning. In the evening the sphere is still 
warm. Witnesses  include  two mayors, a doctor, and three  other authorities  in addition to the dozens of peasants 
who are present. A kind of door open s and a person emerges . He is dressed in a tight -fitting suit and, se eing all the 
people, sa ys some words that are not understood . He runs into the woods. The sphere explode s silently, throwing 
pieces everywhere, and these pieces burn until they are powder. Th e original source is allegedly  from a June 17  
report by a Police Inspector Liabeuf  and forwarded to the French Academy of Sciences . However, the Academy 
reported in 2006 that it has no knowledge of such a report in its archives. Probable hoax. (Alberto Penoglio,

1798  
 
1798, September 10 — Before midnight. Schoolmaster Alexander Campbell and one other person observe a “remarkable 
comet, or meteor” at Alnwick, Northumberland, England. It rapidly increase s in brightness, changing from a star -
like object to a shape like “two half -moons, back to back, having a short luminous stream between the two backs” 
over the course of 5 minutes . (Annual Register  1798, p. 83 ) 
 
1801  
 1801 — British astronomer William Herschel  writes that  the Sun’s cold interior is inhabited. (George Basalla, Civilized

1803  
 
1803, February 22 (or March 24) — An attractive young woman aged 18 –20 years old arrives on a beach aboard a 
“hollow ship ” (Utsuro -bune ) that looks like a rice cooking pot or incense burner in Hitachi province, Japan. 
Fishermen bring her inland to investigate further, but the woman is unable to communicate in  Japanese . She is 
dressed in a foreign fashion made of  unknown fabrics and is clutching  an ornate box also marked with the 
unknown script . The vessel is covered in hieroglyphs that no one can decipher. The fishermen return her and her 
vessel to the sea, where it drifts away. Accounts of the tale appear in three texts:  Toen shōsetsu  (1825),  Hyōryū 
kishū  (1835), and  Ume -no-chiri  (1844), but no official records mention it. ( Wikipedia, “ Utsuro -bune ”; Kazuo

1808  
 
1808, May 16 — 4:00 p.m. Swedish lichenologist Erik Acharius  watches a stream of dark -brown spherical objects 
moving slowly through the sky  in a straight line over Biskopsberga, near Skänninge, Sweden. Some hover 
temporarily and speed up, while others fall to earth. The objects appear in the western sky and stream to the east 
for 2 hours. Some are apparently linked together in groups of three , six, or eight, and all of them have some kind 
of trail.  A few of them fall in the vicinity of K. G. Wettermark, who has also been observing. They resemble soap 
bubbles  and dissipate quickly, leaving a film like cobweb.  (Erik Acharius, “ Besynnerligt Meteor -Phenomén, ”

1819  
 
1819, August 13  — 8:00–9:00 p.m. A brilliant white fireball streaks across the sky at Amherst, Massachusetts. The next 
morning, Erastus Dewey finds a strange substance 20 feet from his front door and assumes it is residue from the 
meteorite. It is abo ut 8 inches in diameter, resembles an upside -down salad dish , and consists of buff -colored 
pulpy substance with an overwhelmingly bad smell . It is covered with a nap that, when removed, causes the 
interior to liquefy and form a starchy substance. A couple days later, it largely dissipates.  Geologist Edward 
Hitchcock  thinks it is some kind of “gelatinous fungus” common to the area in the late summer.  (Rufus Graves ,

1820  
 
1820, February 12 — 10:45 a.m. A German astronomer and cleric named Steinh übel watches a clearly defined dark 
orange -red spot traversing the disc of the Sun in about five hours.  Canon Augustin Stark also observes the object 
at a slightly different time from Augsburg, Germany; it has an orange -gold tint. (Richard C. Carrington, “ On 
Some Previous Observations of Supposed Planetary Bodies in Transit over the  Sun, ” Monthly Notices of the

1824  
 
1824  — Bavarian a stronomer Franz von Gruithuisen  of Munich , Germany, writes Discovery of Many Distinct Traces of 
Lunar Inhabitants, Especially of One of their Colossal Buildings,  in which he announces his discovery of a city  
on the Moon  in the rough terrain to the north of  Schröter  crater that he names the  Wallwerk . This region contains 
a series of somewhat linear ridges that have a fishbone -like pattern, and, with the small refracting  telescope  he is 
using, can be perceived as resembling buildings complete with streets. His claims are readily refuted using more 
powerful instruments. Gruithuisen also thinks that the mysterious “ashen light” observed on Venus ’s dark side is 
due to a fest ival of fire in honor of the “ascension of a new emperor to the throne of the planet.” Later, he 
speculates that the illumination is caused by burning jungles to create new farmland. (Franz von Paula

1826  
 
1826, April 1 — 4:00 p.m. Stone mason Johannes Becker hears  a noise resembling thunder at Rastpfuhl, northwest of  
Saarbrücken, Germany, and sees a grayish object “like two pieces of tin” approaching the earth with lightning 
speed and expanding itself like a sheet  before falling to earth, apparently not far away.  After one minute there is 
another sound like thunder  and a strong whirlwind , as if coming from an impact . Pastor Köllner collect s testimony 
from other nearby witnesses and visit s the supposed landing site but f inds no burn marks or  meteorit ic stones .

1829  
 
1829, August 20 — 11:00 p.m. A man on the York Road east of Leeds, England , sees a moon -like object split into two 
halves, the upper half of which gives off an apparent shaft of light. He sees two human figures visible to the waist, 
one of which has a red cloth around its head. The object is visible for more than one hour and is  seen by others, 
during which time a cloud passes in front of it. ( “Celestial Phenomena, ” York Herald,  August 22, 1829, p. 2;

1835  
 
1835, May 11 — At the Palermo Observatory in Italy, astronomer Niccolò Cacciatore  detects  a starlike object  in the 
Southern sky between the constellations Virgo and Crater moving at a slow rate that might indicate a planet 
beyond Uranus. It is nowhere to be seen during his next observation on May 14. (“Supposed New Planet, ” 
American Journal of Science  31 (1837): 158 –159) 
 
1835, August 25 –31 — The New York Sun  publishes a series of six articles on the alleged discovery by English 
astronomer John Herschel  of plants, animals, and winged people on the lunar surface. Using a huge and powerful 
telescope, Herschel supposedly  sees herds of bison -like quadrupeds, a spherical amphibious creature, and a 
bipedal beave r that lives in huts. The humans are man -bats “covered, except on the face, with short and glossy 
copper -colored hair, and had wings composed of a thin membrane, without hair, lying snugly upon their backs.” The article is an elaborate hoax. Herschel hasn ’t observed life on the moon at all, nor is Herschel even aware of 
the story until much later. The announcement causes enormous excitement throughout America and Europe. 
Authorship of the article is usually attributed to Richard Adams Locke , a reporter who is working for  the Sun at 
the time . Locke publicly admits to being the author in 1840, in a letter to the weekly paper  New World , although 
his intent is satire, not misinformation.  (Wikipedia, “ Great Moon Hoax ”; Richard Adams Locke, The Moon Hoax ,

1838  
 
1838  — Scottish  minister and science writer Thomas Dick  publishes Celestial Scenery : The Wonders of the Planetary 
System Displayed , in which he suggests that every planet in the Solar System is inhabited. At his home in 
Broughty Ferry, Dundee, he  computes that the Solar System contains 21.9 trillion inhabitants, 53.5 billion of them 
on Venus. This is done comparing the surface area of each planet and the population density of England. ( Thomas

1840  
 
1840, May 13  — Before sunrise. Some Polynesians at Felalatai  on the island of Upolu, Samoa, observe a bright red star, 
“closely encircled by a number of other stars of the ordinary appearance.” (“A Strange Phenomenon, ” Journal of 
the Polynesian Society  7 (1898): 49)  
 
1845  
 
1845, June 18  — 10:30 p.m. The British brig Victoria , captained by George Henry Caithness , is becalmed in the Strait of 
Sicily about 30 miles southwest of Licata, Sicily, Italy, when a huge wind suddenly blows from the east for two 
hours. Then the wind suddenly stops, and the crew feels an overpowering heat and smells a sulfuric stench. At 
this moment three “luminous bodies” emerge from the sea about one -half mile away and remain visible for 10 
minutes. Shortly thereafter the wind picks up again.  (This could be a magma plume from an undersea volcanic 
vent.) Around 7:10 p.m.,  at Ainab, Lebanon, two objects five times as large as the moon, joined by “streamers or 
appendages,” are observed in the west and remain visible for one hour, moving slowly on an easterly course. The 
objects are so bright they are painful to look at. A possible outgassing event from the Madrepore subsea vent.

1846  
 
1846, July 5 — 5:57 a.m. Brazilian Frigate Captain Augusto Leverger  is in command of two gunboats on the Río 
Paraguay about 19 miles away from Asunción, Paraguay, when he observes a luminous globe moving quickly to  
the north -northwest. It leaves a luminous trail in which three objects can be seen that are as bright as the full 
moon. The bottom object is shaped like a fan with “broken rays” at its rear; the middle one is nearly circular; and 
the top object is an irre gular quadrangle. Above them is a ribbon of faint light in a zigzag pattern. The three 
objects gradually change shape to flat ellipses and become misty, remaining in sight for 25 minutes before fading 
away. The display is also seen by  the Brazilian ambassa dor to Paraguay, José Antônio Pimenta Bueno . (Gazeta Official do Imperio do Brasil,  vol. 1, no. 74 (November 26, 1846 ), p. 295; “ Diario do Reconhecimento do Rio

1847, March 19  — 8:30 p.m. A woman and her companion are in Highbury East, London, England, when they notice 
what seems to be a fire balloon ascending slowly in the west, seemingly over Hampstead. It shoots out “several 
fiery coruscations” and turns into an intensely radiant cloud, which moves on further west. Its light shines down 
on the houses below. Suddenly another bright cloud appears above the first. After 2 –3 minutes, a fiery ball drops 
from the upper cloud to the lower one, followed by two others.  Soon after this, both clouds disappear.  (“Meteoric 
Stones, ” Littell ’s Living Age  56 (1858): 503)

1850, September 15  — 6:20 p.m. Senior medical officer Elisha Kent Kane  and other crew members of the USS Advance , 
participating in the First Grinnell Expedition to the Arctic to determine the fate of the lost Franklin No rthwest 
Passage expedition,  watch a balloon -like object over the Wellington Channel between Cornwallis and Devon 
islands, Nunavut, Canada. It is floating slowly northward and appears to be 2 feet long by  18 inches wide. After a 
short time, a small object appears below it. (Elisha Kent Kane, The U.S. Grinnell Expedition in Search of Sir John 
Franklin,  Harper and Brothers, 1854, p. 190 )  
 
1854  
 
1854, March 21  — 9:30 p.m. People in Washington, D.C., see a brilliant light in the sky overhead “like a coal of fire 
glowing,” red in color and stationary. It is visible for 20 –30 minutes before it fades away. (“Atmospherical 
Phenomenon, ” Gettysburg (Pa.) Adams Sentinel,  March 27, 1854, p. 1)   
 
1855 
 
1855, January 22  — 10:00 p.m.  A witness walking in the public square in New Haven, Connecticut, sees a brilliant red 
fireball in the sky near the star Gamma Draconis. At first it is stationary , but after 15 seconds it moves slowly 
toward the east with a slight undulatory motion. It passes below the star Eta Ursae Majoris and disappears not far 
from Denebola in the constellation Leo. The object is visible for 10 minutes. ( “Meteoric Phenomenon, ” New York 
Times,  January 25, 1855, p. 1)  
 
1857  
 
1857, June 19 or 20 — Sunset. A large cloud moves in over Carbondale, Pennsylvania, from the northwest, accompanied 
by considerable wind. It emits a  dark-looking substance that falls to the ground, where it becomes highly 
luminous. It moves toward a large barn and passes through its center, setting it on fire, and continues on in a 
straight course for the woods, burning up the underbrush . It makes a path about 16 feet wide for a distance of 3 
miles, and it finally stops against an outcrop of anthracite coal 60 feet in thickness. It leaves a sulfurous mass 
behind.  (“Extraordinary Meteoric Phenomenon, ” Baltimore (Md.) Sun,  June 27, 1857, p. 1)  
 
1860 
 1860, July 2 0 — 9:40 p.m. A poem by  Brooklyn, New York, poet Walt Whitman , “Year of Meteors (1859 -60),” 
published in a later edition of Leaves of Grass,  describes a “strange huge meteor -procession dazzling and clear 
shooting over our heads.” For many years, no one could identify the event. Then in 2000, Texas State University –
San Marcos physicist Donald W. Olson  discovered a painting by Hudson River artist Frederic Edwin Church  
depicting two large meteors streaming across the sky and dated July 20, 1860. An examination of contemporary 
newspapers revealed that this was probably Whitman ’s meteor procession. Around 9:40 p.m., two meteors with 
trails, one behind another, are seen in New York, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Norfolk, and other 
locations in the East, proceeding slowly from northwest to southeast for nearly one minute. They are as bright as 
Venus. A rare event, and little understood until 1913, a  meteor procession occurs when an earth -grazing meteor 
breaks apart and the fragments travel across the sky in the same horizontal path. Olson and his colleagues finally 
publish their discovery in the July 2010 issue of Sky & Telescope.  (“The Wonders of the Heavens: The Meteor

1860, August 2 — 11:00 p.m. Another seeming procession of two meteors is observed in Norfolk, Virginia, moving with 
an undulating motion in the western sky in a northerly direction. One of the lights is clear red and the other is 
greenish, and they both emit flashes of light, leaving a sparkling trail. The phenomenon is also seen in Pittsburgh, 
Pennsylvania. Some unnamed contemporary scientists co mpare it to the July 20 meteor procession. ( “Another 
Splendid Meteor, ” Baltimore (Md.) Sun, August 6, 1860 , p. 1 ) 
 
1862  
 
1862  — French astronomer Camille Flammarion  publishes  La pluralité des mondes habités,  in which he proposes that 
many worlds in the universe are inhabited. It is a huge success, going through 33 editions in its first 20 years. 
Flammarion is one of the first to put forward the idea that extraterrestrial beings are genuinely alien and not 
simply variations of earthly creatures.  (Camille Flammarion, La pluralité des mondes habités , Mallet -Bachelier, 
1862)  
 
1862, November — Early morning. Magistrate Osman Edward Middleton  hears a “peculiar rushing noise” at Morpeth,

1865  — French novelist Jules Verne  publishes From the Earth to the Moon.  It tells the story of the Baltimore Gun Club, a 
post–American Civil War  society of weapons enthusiasts, and their attempts to build an enormous  Columbiad  
space gun and launch three people —the Gun Club ’s president, his Philadelphian armor -making rival, and a 
French poet —in a projectile with the goal of a  lunar  landing . (Wikipedia, “ From the Earth to the Moon ”) 
 
1865, December — The British Board of Trade asks Trinity House to investigate the “false lights” of the Durham , 
England,  coast, mysterious revolving lights seen above a rocky headland at Whitburn by mariners negotiating a 
hazardous stretch of the northeast coast.  Between 1860 and 1870, more than 150 ships are wrecked on the rocks 
near Whitburn after following a light or lights in the sky that they wrongly believe are from a lighthouse at the 
mouth of the Tyne.  A commission led by Rear Admiral Richard Collinson  meets in Sunderland on December 28 
to interview witnesses and determine whether salvagers are responsible for the lights that are causing shipwrecks. 
Although the commission decides that the false lights are not deliberately lit, they are puzzled ab out the true 
cause . The lights and wrecks continue until January 1871 when the Souter Lighthouse is erected on Lizard Point .

1866, June 21  — The US Hydrographic Office is established by Congress. I t is assigned to the Navy Bureau of 
Navigation and collects reports from ships ’ officers on observations o f various marine phenomena, hazards, and 
other activities. Among the reports collected are meteors, ball lightning, and other celestial and meteorological 
phenomena. (Wikipedia, “ United States Hydrographic Office ”)

1867, November 4  — 3:00–4:00 p.m. James E. Beveridge is passing the mill by the Waterworks Reservoir in Chatham, 
England , when he and the miller see numerous black discs moving in the air to the west, some in groups, others 
scattered. They are visible for more than 20 minutes . In passing in front of the sun they appear like large cannon 
shot. Several groups pass over his head , disappearing suddenly, and leaving puffs of grayish brown smoke.

1868 
 
1868, June 8 — 9:50 p.m. John Lucas Sr., an observer at Radcliffe Observatory, Oxford University, England , notices a 
comet -like object with a trail a bit west of the star Polaris. As he is pointing it out to some others, it begins 
moving west. It moves in a straight line at first, then moves south for a bit, then continues to the north. They 
watch it for 4 minutes until it disappears below the northwestern horizon. ( “Remarkable Meteor, ” English 
Mechanic  7 (July 10, 1868): 351)  
 
1868, July 25 — Engineer Frederick William Birmingham  of Parramatta, New South Wales, watches a bizarre procession 
of the faces of two prominent Australian s (Archbishop of Sydney Frederic Barker  and New South Wales Premier 
James Martin ) through the air as well as a vessel he calls an “ark.” He hears a voi ce suggesting that “That ’s a 
machine to go through the air.” The voice comes from a “ spirit” w hom he describes as “ like a neutral tint shade 
and the shape of a man in his usual frock dress .” After the ark maneuvers for a while  in the air , the spirit say s, 
“Have you a desire or do you wish to enter upon it?” He is then lifted up and carried through the air into the 
object about 60 feet away. The spirit guides him into the “pilot house” of the machine where he is given some 
papers with formulas on them that will help him construct a flying machine. He observes another UFO -like craft 
on March 9, 1873, and later attempts to build a mechanical replica of wha t he has seen. ( Bill Chalker, “ The

1869 
 
1869  — French poet and inventor Charles Cros  is convinced that pinpoints of light observed on Mars and Venus are the 
lights of large cities on those planets. He spen ds years petitioning the French government to build a giant mirror 
to communicate with the Martians and Venusians by burning giant lines on the deserts of those planets. (Alissa 
Walker, “ A French Inventor Once Proposed a Giant Mirror to Burn a Message on Mars, ” Gizmodo, October 16,

1869, August 7 — 12:00 noon. Four or five witnesses watch a luminous object land in a vacant lot about 200 yards north 
of the village of Adamstown, Pennsylvania. It is originally square -shaped but shoots up into a column about 3 –4 feet high and 2 feet thick. The object glitters like a “column of burnished silver.” It gradually fades away and 
disappears after 10 minutes. No unusual traces are found on the lot. (“Singular  Phenomenon, ” Lancaster (Pa.) 
Daily Evening Express,  August 10, 1869, pp. 2 –3) 
1869, August 7 — About 4:45 p.m. During a total solar eclipse, four amateur observers in St. Paul Junction  [now Le 
Mars ], Iowa,  both with and without instruments , independently notice a bright object below the lunar disc and just 
outside the solar corona. There are no visible stars in that position in the sky . (“Was It the Intra -Mercurial

1870, March 22 — 6:30 p.m. Capt. Frederick William Banner, master of the barque Lady of the Lake,  is sailing in the 
North Atlantic 400 miles north of  the Equator and 860 miles from the coast of West Africa when he sees a 
“curious -shaped ” light-gray cloud in the south -southeast . It is circular, with four rays or arms extending from the 
center to the edge, and a curved tail. It is visible for about 50 minutes until it is too dark to see.  (Frederick

1870, September 26 — A luminous  object  with a tail is seen in the constellation Lyra by Reginald Brabazon , 12th Earl of 
Meath , second secretary of the British legation to the North German Confederation, in Berlin , Germany . Possibly 
a light pillar reflection caused by a bright arc -light source at a military installation  on Eiswerder island.

1871  — English astronom er Richard A. Proctor  writes Othe r Worlds Than Ours,  in which he discusse s the question of the 
plurality of worlds in the light of new facts. He suspects that Venus is likely the “abode of living creatures not 
unlike the inhabitants of earth.” (Richard A. Proctor, Other Worlds Than Ours , Appleton, 1871 ) 
 
1871, August 1 — 10:43 p.m. Astronomer Jérôme Eugène Coggia  at Marseille Observatory, France, watches a slow , 
blood -red fireball move across the sky and change course twice before falling to the earth. He sees it for 20 
minutes and 20 seconds. Possible earth -grazing meteor or a candle balloon. ( Jérome Eugène Coggia , “Observation

1873  — English -American geologist and psychometrist William Denton  of Wellesley, Massachusetts, publishes volume 3 
of The Soul of Things,  in which he describes his astral visit to Mars along with his sister Anna Cridge , his wife 
Elizabeth , and his son Sherman . He finds it harbors a thriving civilization with a technology based on aluminum. 
He reports  that t hey soar above traffic on their individual fly -cycles and seem particularly fond of air travel , with 
as many as 30 Martians occupy ing some of the large flying conveyances.  Sherman says the Martians have blond 
hair and blue eyes like cats’ eyes; Anna adds that they have l ong arms and large hands and feet, and there is 
another group of short, hairy, black people.  (William Denton, Soul of Things,  Wellesley, Mass.: E lizabeth M. F.

1873, Late March  — Evening. Thomas Inman and his son are traveling home from the village of Taylorsville [now Philo], 
Ohio, and are possibly in Bristol Township when they see a bright light descending swiftly with a roaring noise. It 
lands a short distance in the road [probably Lawrence Road] ahead of them, flickers and flares, then fades. A man dressed in a suit of black carrying a lantern emerges from the object. He walks a few paces and steps into a buggy, 
which Inman has not noticed before. The buggy begins to move silently and quickly, even though there is no 
horse attached to it, until it re aches a deep gully, into which it plunges and disappears. Historian William 
Alexander  Taylor , who supplies the story to the New York Herald,  vouches for the witnesses. (“Very Like  a 
Whale, ” New York Herald , April 8 , 187 3, p. 7; Clark III 1123 –1124;  Chris Aubeck and Martin Shough, Return to

1874, April 24 — 3:30 p.m. Chemist and astronomer Vojtěch Šafařík  of Prague  [now in the Czech Republic] sees “an 
object of so peculiar a character that I  do not know what to make of it.” It is a dazzling white object slowly 
crossing the moon. He first sees it in front of the moon, then watches it against the “deep blue sky like Sirius or 
Vega in daylight .” (Vojtěch Šafařík , “Telescopic Meteors, ” Astronomical Register  23 (1885): 205 –211) 
 
1874, August 13 —11:00 p.m. A large, “luminous electric cloud” flies over the western edge of Pascagoula, Mississippi, 
from the northwest to the southeast. It illuminates the ground and emits heat so intense that some witnesses think 
their houses are about to ignite. When last seen over the Gulf of Mexico, it renders the spars and rigging of a ship 
“distinctly visible.” ( “Singular Phenomenon, ” Pascagoula (Miss.) Star,  August 22, 1874, p. 2 ; “Singular

1876, December 21  — 8:30–8:45 p.m. A bright bolide  that explodes and breaks up into a group of 20 –100 smaller balls  is 
seen over a wide swath of the US from Topeka, Kansas, to western Pennsylvania. Over Columbus, Ohio, it is 
described as “a cluster or flock of meteors seemingly huddled together, like a flock of wild geese, and moving 
with the same velocity and grace of regular ity. The color of their light was a yellowish red, like red rocket -balls.” 
A stony chondrite falls 3 miles northwest of Rochester, In diana , at the same time . (James Glaisher , et al., “Report

1877, October — Astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli  reports seeing canali  on the Martian surface  from Brera Observatory 
in Milan, Italy,  during the Great  Opposition. While the term “canals” indicates an artificial construction, its proper 
translation as  “channels” implie s that the observed features are natural configurations of the planetary surface. 
From the incorrect translation into the term “canals,” various assumptions are made about life on Mars; as these 
assumptions are popularized, the canals  become famous, giving rise to waves of hypotheses, speculation, and 
fiction  about the possibility of intelligent life on Mars —the Martians.  Later, thanks to the observations of the 
Italian astronomer Vincenzo Cerulli , scientists c ome to the conclusion that the famous channels are actually mere 
optical illusions.  (Wikipedia, “ Martian canal s”)

1878, January 22 — John Martin is out hunting near his ranch 6 miles north of Dallas , Texas, when he notices a dark 
object high in the southern sky. It is so bright it hurts his eyes as it moves  with great speed to directly ove r his 
head. The object is “about the size of a large saucer” and looks like a large balloon. It speeds away rapidly. ( “A 
Strange Phenomena, ” Dallas  Daily Herald , January 2 3, 1878 , p. 4; Patrick Gross, “ The First Publicized Flying 
‘Saucer ’ Report? ”; “Dallas 1878, ” Texas UFO Museum and Research Library, February 5, 2014 ) 
 
1878, July 29 — About 12:30 p.m. Astronomers  James Craig Watson , director of the  Ann Arbor (Mich.) Observatory , 
and Lewis Swift , an amateur from  Rochester, New York , both claim to se e planet -like object s close to the Sun  during the total solar eclipse . Watson, observing from  Separation  Point , Wyoming , place s the “ruddy star” about 
2.5° southwest  of the Sun and estimate s its magnitude  at 4.5. Watson says it has a definite dis c, unlike stars, 
which appear as shimmering pinpoints of light. He also noes another object  further to the west. Swift, observing 
from a location near  Denver, Colorado , also sees what he t akes to be an intra -mercurial planet (“a round red disk 
and being free from twinkling”) about 3 ° southwest of the Sun. He estimate s its brightness to be the same as that 
of Theta Cancri , a fifth -magnitude star which is also visible during totality, about six or seven minutes from the 
object . Swift also notes a second equally bright object. Both Watson and Swift describe at least one of their 
object s as red in color.  The idea that four objects are observed during the eclipse generate s controversy in 
scientific journals and mockery from German -American astronomer  Christian Heinrich Friedrich Peters . Peters 
considers Swift’s measurements as ambiguous and notes that the margin of error in the pencil -and-cardboard 
recording device Watson had used was large enough to plausibly include a bright known star.  (James C. Watson,

1880, March 22 — About 6:00 a.m. A large number of brilliantly luminous bodies are seen to rise from the horizon and 
pass from east to west at Kattenau, East Prussia [now Furmanovka, Kaliningrad Oblast, Russia]. They move 
through space “like a string of beads.” Possible meteor procession. (“ A Remarkable Phenomenon ,” Nature  22

1880, March 26 — Night. The train depot operator and a few friends are walking at Galisteo  Junction [now Lamy] , New 
Mexico, when they hear loud voices and laughter coming from a “large balloon” shaped like a fish approaching 
from the west. A flower is dropped from the car of the balloon to which is attached a slip of silk -like paper on 
which Chinese characters are  written. The next morning, searchers find a cup of peculiar workmanship, but both 
artifacts are purchased by a “wealthy young Chinaman”  and a “collector of curio sities”  who visits town on March 
28, although this part of the tale seems facetious and racist.  The yarn is typical of sensational newspaper hoaxes 
that have no basis in reality.  (“Galisteo ’s Apparition, ” Santa Fe Weekly New Mexican,  March 29, 1880, p. 3 ;

1880, June? — David Muckle and W. R. McKay of East Kent [now Chatham -Kent], Ontario, are in a field on Muckle’s 
farm when they hear a loud explosion and see a  cloud of stones flying upward. They go to the spot and find a 
circular area, 16 feet across, that has been swept clean of vegetation. (“ A Curious Phenomenon, ” Rock Hill (S.C.)

1880, Early July — A train is running on the Chattanooga Railroad near Murfreesboro, Tennessee, in a thunderstorm 
when the engineer sees a large ball of fire rushing down the rails to the engine. As it passes under the locomotive, 
he feels a shock that jars the entire train. There is a loud explosion “opposite the ladies ’ car” and a telegraph pole 
is splintered from top to bottom. ( “Passengers Shocked by Lightning, ” Memphis (Tenn.) Public Ledger,  July 15,

1880,  July 28 — 6:00–7:00 p.m. C. A. Youngman and Ben Flexner are looking out a drugstore window at 2 nd and 
Chestnut streets in Louisville, Kentucky, when they see something in the air coming from the direction of the 
Ohio River bridge. As it approaches them, it appears to be a man surrounded by machinery, which he is working 
with his hands and feet. The ob ject is too high to make out the details of its construction.  The man moves off to 
the south, pedaling constantly.  Around 8:00 p.m., the Royster family of Madisonville, Kentucky, watches a 
circular flying object with a ball at each end moving above the tra in depot. (“More Monkeying, ” Louisville (Ky.)

 1880, September 30 —9:45 p.m. A brilliant object is seen crossing the sky in Columbus, Georgia, at a very low altitude. 
Coming from the south, it heads northeasterly in a horizontal line . It appears made of three perfectly developed 
balls of an equal size and equidistant from each other. The first ball emits a tail that envelops the two following 
and extends behind them. The tail is luminous except at the far end, where it is indistinct a nd nebulous. It is 
visible for a full 50 seconds and continues on its course without falling. ( “Wonders of a Meteor, ” Marion (Ohio)

1881, Late October — An unusual fall of spider web occurs near the coast of Lake Michigan at Milwaukee, Green Bay, 
Fort Howard, Sheboygan, and Ozaukee County , Wisconsin . The webs seem to come from “over the lake” and fall 
from a great height. The strands are from 2 feet to several yards long, strong in texture, and very white. No spi ders 
are seen. (“ A Rain of Spider Webs, ” Scientific American  45 (1881): 337)

without a trail move across the sky from the constellation of Ursa Minor to Capricorn in 45 seconds.  (N. S. 
Drayton, “ A Supposed Meteor, ” Scientific American  47 (July 22, 1882): 53)  
 
1882, November 17 — 6:00 p.m. An auroral beam is observed from the Royal Observatory, Greenwich , London,  by 
astronomer Edward Walter Maunder  and by John Rand Capron  from his private observatory on Hog’s Back , 
Surrey, England , in association with a geomagnetic storm. The beam is described in detail in various ways, 
including as a “beam ,” “spindle,” “definite body” with a Zeppelin -like shape and pale green color, passing from 
horizon to horizon above the moon. The phenomenon  transit s the sky in approximately 75 seconds . (Wikipedia,

1883, February 5  — 6:45 p.m. A  witness at Lake Glasfjorden, near Arvika, Sweden, spots a meteor -like object high on the 
horizon moving from southeast to northwest. It makes several minor course changes, varies its color from white to 
yellow, and emits some sparks. After 18 seconds, it changes its course to the southeast and is so low to the ground 
that its light is reflected in the lake. By this time , it has a distinct tail. Total duration is 50 seconds. ( “On February

1883, August 12 –13 — Astronomer José Árbol y Bonilla , director of the El Cerro de la Bufa Meteorological Observatory 
in Zacatecas, Mexico, is observing the sun by eyepiece projection when he and an assistant see a large number of 
small bodies crossing the solar disc. Over the course of two days , they count a total of 447 dark objects. They 
seem bright as they approach the sun but are dark as they pass across its face. He takes several photographs and 
suspects that they are relatively near the earth. Mexican astronomers in 2011 suggested  that a comet may 
have  split into several pieces; these objects were estimated to have had a size of between 150 and 3,350  feet, and 
to have passed only 334 to 5,000  miles from the Earth; they thought a fragmented  Comet 12P/Pons -Brooks  was 
one possibility, in which case Earth barely avoided multiple  Tunguska events  or even a  mass extinction ; this was 
reported  in the media  and disputed  in October 2011; but the source of these objects  could also have been comet 
C/1883 D1 (Brooks -Swift) or even a thir d, unknown comet that year; the event also coincided with the 
annual  Perseid  meteor shower; even  migrating birds  cannot be ruled out.  (José Á. y Bonilla, “ Passage sur le

1884, June 6 — 1:00 p.m.  Ranch er John W. Ellis and some of his ranch hands  in south -central Dundy County, Nebraska, 
allegedly see a blazing object fall from the sky and crash into many pieces, burning the grass and fusing the sand. 
The light is so intense it blinds one of them. The newspaper suggests it is a “vessel belonging or iginally to some 
other planet.” The remains of the object are said to have dissolved in a rainstorm. However, the tale is actually a 
fictional story written by a correspondent in Benkelman. ( Wikipedia, “ Dundy County UFO Hoax ”; “A Celestial

1884, July 3  — 8:30 p.m.  L. C. Yale of Norwood, New York, watches an object with a long tail move slowly from east to 
west. It has a “nucleus like a globe, as large as the moon, surrounded by a bright ring, two dark lines crossing the 
nucleus in vertical direction, the lines larger in the middle, straight on inside, curved on outside, tapering both 
ways to points.” The general appearance is of a “gigantic sword of fire, moving handle first.”  (“A Great Meteor, ”

1885, February 16 — Night. During a severe snowstorm,  a bright light suddenly flashes in the high rocks on the 
Pennsylvania side of the Delaware River some five miles northwest of Port Jervis, New York.  The snow -covered 
hill glows like red -hot iron for several feet around, gleaming through the storm for several minutes, then growing 
dim and disappearing. (“ Mysterious Light, ” Wichita (Kan.) Beacon,  March 25, 1885, p. 1)  
1885, February 25 — 5:00 a.m. Sailing in the North Paci fic some 800 miles west of Victoria, British Columbia, Capt ain 
John Waters of the bar que Innerwick  and his mate see the sky turning fiery red. Suddenly a large fireball appears 
above the ship and falls hissing into the sea about 150 feet away from them, causing a  wave of water to impact the 
ship.  Electrical discharges run through the rigging and the masts.  (“Frightful Experience at Sea, ” Sacramento

1886  — French novelist Jules Verne  publishes Robur the Conqueror,  which describes the appearance of mysterious 
objects and strange lights in the sky all over the world. It turns out that the sightings are of a flying machine, 
invented by the novel ’s anti -hero Robur, who kid naps people and takes them on board the airship. (Wikipedia, 
“Robur the Conqueror ”)  
 
1886, October 24 — Night. Nine persons who are sleeping in a hut some 10 miles from Maracaibo, Venezuela, are 
awakened by a loud humming noise and a dazzling light that illuminates the interior. The people begin to pray but 
they start vomiting as extensive swellings appear on the uppe r part of their bodies, especially around the face and 
lips. They feel no heat, although the light has a smoky appearance and  a peculiar smell.  The next mo rning, the 
swellings subside but leave black blotches. By November 2, the skin peels off and the blotches are round sores. 
Portions of their hair falls off.  Trees around the hut show no damage until November 2, when they suddenly 
wither.  The symptoms are similar to those of ionizing radiation syndrome.  (Warner Cowgill,  “Curious 
Phenomenon in Venezuela, ” letter, Scientific American  55 (December 18, 1886): 389;  Clark III 949;  Patrick

1887, March 19 — 5:00 p.m. Captain C ornelis  Dirks Swart of the Dutch bark J.P.A.  sees a “meteor in the shape of two 
balls” during a storm in the North Atlantic  about 590 miles northeast of Bermuda . One ball is black and the other 
is luminous and oblong. The luminous object descends with a roar and lights up the ship and surrounding water. 
The crew fe els heat from the object even as solid lumps of ice fall on the deck and the rigging becomes iced. The 
side of t he ship where it falls turns partially  black and the copper plating is blistered. The wind increases to 
“hurricane force .” (“Rare Electrical Phenomenon at Sea, ” American Meteorological Journal  4 (July 1887): 98–

1887,  October 24 — Sunset. A man in Fine, New York, is looking to the east when he sees a group of sparkling silver 
balls “tumbling and rushing through the air going towards the east” and finally disappearing in the clouds. The 
display is visible for about 4 mi nutes and is seen by others in town. ( “Fine, ” Gouverneur (N.Y.) Free Press,

1887, November 12 — Midnight. Captain R. F. Moore of the English steamer SS Siberian,  sailing 10 nautical miles o ff 
Cape Race, Newfoundland, watches an enormous fireball rising  from the sea to the height of 15 feet. It travels 
against the strong wind and comes close to the ship, then turns to the southeast and disappears.  The object is seen 
for nearly 5  minutes.  Moore says he has seen this phenomenon befo re and considers  it a sign of stormy weather.

1888, Early September  — 3:15 p.m. During a severe thunderstorm, after a flash of lightning and a peal of thunder, 
witnesses see a huge flame at Highland Lake, near Winsted, Connecticut. The water is parted for yards by a huge 
ball of fire at least 10 feet in diameter, and billows  rise on either side to a height of 20 feet. The light moves 
toward the head of the lake with great velocity. When it is within 100 yards of the shore, another flash of lightning  
strikes, and the fireball disappears. The waters of the lake remain disturbed  for hours. ( “A Ball of Fire on a Lake, ”

1889, February 7  — 6:00 p.m. A cylindrical luminous object passes over Oella, Maryland, at only several hundred feet 
altitude. It lights up the village “as brilliantly as if by a strong electric lamp.” It curves and appears to descend to 
the ground one mile away. It follows  the course of the Patapsco River to the north for seve ral seconds. ( “A 
Brilliant Meteor, ” Washington (D.C.) Evening Star,  February 9, 1889, p. 6)  
 
1891 
 
1891, June 13 — Day. An unnamed witness  claims to see a “meteor” explode with a loud noise over the Wasson & Miller 
flour mill and cotton gin in Dublin, Texas. The object looks like “a bale of cotton suspended in the air after having 
been saturated in kerosene oil and ignited, except that it created a much brighter light”  that dazzles people 
standing several hundred feet away. The object shatters into pieces before it hits the ground, the fragments setting 
the grass and weeds on fire. In addition to the fragments is a scrap of paper with writing  in a strange language. (“Meteoric Explosion, ” The Dublin (Tex.) Progress,  June 20, 1891, p. 5; “Dublin 1891, ” Texas UFO Museum and

1891, May 14 or August 14 — Sunset. May King and some others in Toponas, Colorado, see a large round object 
surrounded by light moving about in the sky during a rainstorm. It is revolving as it travels slowly toward the 
northeast, leaving a luminous trail. (Fran ces Melrose, “ Requests Fly in for UFO Information, ” Denver (Colo.) 
Rocky Mountain News,  February 6, 1994, via UFO Newsclipping Service,  no. 297 (April 1994): 10)  
 
1891, July 12 — 7:00 p.m. Residents of Theodore Street in Ottawa, Ontario, see over the rifle range a cigar -shaped 
balloon with a bright  light on one end and a fan on the other  traveling from south to north. ( MacLeod (Ont.) 
Gazette,  July 16 , 1891; Clark 45 ) 
 
1891, September 2 — 8:00 p.m. Alonzo M. Swan  and L. D. Dodson (an equestrian recovering from an illness) are camped 
in Coyote Springs, New Mexico [now within the bounds of Kirtland Air Force Base south of Albuquerque],  to 
benefit from the mineral springs there when they see a brilliant light rise above a mountain to the south. As it 
moves closer against the wind, they see it has a series of “electric arc lights” around it and a “pole” or rudder  that 
is similarly lit. The object is in view for nearly two hours. Another lighted object appears from the southwest and 
approaches the first object, but clouds prevent any further o bservation.  Swan sees a lighted object again on 
September 4 , although this time it could be a star . (“Strange Mid Air Ships, ” Albuquerque (N.Mex.) Weekly

1891,  September 5 — 2:00 a.m. Two employees of an ice house in Crawfordsville, Indiana, Marshall McIntyre and Bill 
Gray, notice a white object  about 300–400 feet in the air that is flying by means of several pairs of fins. It appears 
to be 18–20 feet long and 8 feet wide  and has a single red glowing eye or light. When it begins circling a nearby 
residence  on East Main Street , the two men take shelter in a barn. It moves away to the east but soon returns, 
whereupon the witnesses drive back to the ice house i n their carriage. Rev. George W. Switzer , a Methodist 
minister , reports a similar apparition above his church . Some locals are convinced that the object was either an 
illusion created by the town’s recently installed electric lights reflecting through the damp air and rain, or a flock 
of frightened killdeers. (“A Strange Phenomenon,” Crawfordsville (Ind.) Daily Journal,  September 5, 1891, p. 1;

1892 
 
1892, January? — George W. Crusselle  and S. D. Cuthereil from the USS Thetis  are wandering among the salt water 
lagoons on the west coast of Baja California, Mexico , when they see a luminous object with smooth edges about 
30 feet in diameter approaching from the ocean at an altitude of 50 feet. It changes shape from circular to an 
hourglass and moves swiftly to the surface of a lagoon, covering it with a “brilliant halo of light.” It rises 
moments later, changing its shape frequently,  and moving swiftly in a zigzag fashion. After 15 minutes it 
disappears inland.  (George  W. Crusselle, “ The Coast Survey, ” Atlanta Constitution,  April 10, 1892, p. 9)  
 
1892, March 23 — Evening –1:00 a.m.  Residents of Warsaw, Poland,  watch a balloon over the city that casts rays of light 
from an electrical apparatus. It remains stationary until 1:00 a.m., then it takes off to the west. Other supposed 
balloo ns are seen March 22 or earlier over Kaunas  Fortress , Lithuania; and Modlin Fortress  (in Nowy Dwór 
Mazowiecki ), Sosnowiec , Dąbrowa Górnicza,  and Dąbrowice, Poland . As they remain stationary for as long as 40 
minutes, some assume they are piloted by German spies. ( “Spying by Balloon, ” New York Evening World,  March

 1892, April 16 — Witnesses at Przemyśl Fortress , Poland, see a bright point of light in the north that seems to be a sphere 
emitting searchlight beams above and below it. The object  is hovering at an altitude of 2,100 feet and begins 
circling. (Poland 7 –8) 
 
1892, June 1 — 11:30 p.m . A large balloon carrying a searchlight and four passengers passes over Newark, New Jersey, 
descending as low as 20 feet from  the ground. (“Mysterious Balloon Sighted,” Trenton (N.J.) Times,  June 2, 1892 ; 
Clark III 70 ) 
1892, June 19 — Night. J. L. Shaw of Conyers, Georgia, sees a mysterious lig ht in the sky from which balls of fire fall to 
the ground near him. (“ Saw Balls of Fire, ” Atlanta Constitution,  June 21, 1892, p. 10)  
 
1892, August 30 — 11:00 p.m. Several people in Waxahachie, Texas, see a “kind of balloon” with colored lights passing 
over the northern part of the city after hearing a man shouting a greeting. ( “What Was It? ” Galveston (Tex.) Daily 
News,  September  2, 1892, p. 6 ; Clark III 70 ) 
 
1892, September 20 — Large quantities of a white, thread -like substance fall from the sky du ring a rainstorm at 
Gainesville, Florida. Samples are sent to arachnologist George Marx  of the US Department of Agriculture, who 
performs a chemical analysis that shows it to be from migrating spiders. (“ Spider Web from the Clouds, ”

1893, February 24 –25 — 10:00 p.m. Charles J ames  Norcock , captain of the corvette  HMS Caroline , is sailing about 16 
miles south of Jeju Island, South Korea, in the Korea Strait when the officer of the watch observes some round 
lights resembling “Chinese lanterns festooned between the masts of a lofty vessel.” They are moving slowly north 
and appear  to be in the air between the ship and the Hallasan volcano on Jeju. They are visible until roughly 12:00 
midnight , sometimes appearing as a mass, other times strung out more in an irregular line . The ship ’s crew 
observes them again the next night as they are sailing east from Port Hamilton [now the Korean islands of 
Geomundo]. This time they are visible until dawn. Although there are some odd characteristics of this 
observation, the likeliest explanation is that they are inferior mirages of distant fishing  boats, as atmospheric 
conditions are favorable on these dates. (Charles J. Norcock, “ An Atmospheric Phenomenon in the North China 
Sea,” Nature  48 (1893): 76 –77; Martin Shough and Wim van Utrecht, Redemption of the Damned,  vol. 1,

1893, August  18 — Sunrise. People living near the small hamlet of Leslie in Cumberland County, Kentucky, notice that 
the sun has a peculiar color. Thousands of small discs, seemingly about the size of a wagon wheel, appear in the 
sky, all of them in motion. They appear roun d in shape from far away, but when closer to the ground they change 
to triangles, squares, or odd forms. Their colors vary: Some are bright red, others green or black, but when they 
are close to the ground they are all a deep purple color. All are silent. The phenomenon lasts about one hour, 
during which time the villagers fear it is judgment day. ( “Judgment Day, ” St. Louis Globe -Democrat,  August 20, 
1893, p. 9)  
 
1894 
 
1894, February? — Capt. Corning of the British schooner W. and H. Witherspoon  sees several lights rise from the Gulf of 
Mexico off the west coast of Florida. They ascend to a height of 25 feet, explode, and disappear. (“ Cum Grano 
Salis, ” Lowell (Mass.) Daily Sun,  February 8, 1894, p. 1)  
 
1894, May — During the opposition of Mars, the idea that Schiaparelli ’s canali  are really irrigation canals made by 
intelligent beings is first hinted at, and then adopted as the only intelligible explanation, by American 
astronomer  Percival Lowell  in Flagstaff, Arizona, and a few others. The visible seasonal melting of Martian polar 
icecaps fuels speculation that an advanced alien race indigenous to Mars has built the canals to transport the water 
to drier equatorial regions. Newspaper and magazine articles about Martian canals and “Martians” capture the 
public imagination. Lowell publishes his views in three books:  Mars  (1895),  Mars and Its Canals  (1906), 
and Mars As the Abode of Life  (1908). He writes: “The evidence of handicraft, if such it be, points to a highly intelligent mind behind it.” Lowell  remains a strong proponent for the rest of his life of the idea that the canals 
were built for irrigation by an intelligent civilization. (Wikipedia, “ Martian canal s”)  
 
1894, June 7 — Astronomers Percival Lowell  and William H. Pickering  at Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona, see 
two “dazzling white specks” for a few moments on the south polar cap of Mars.  The most likely explanation is the 
reflection of sunlight from ice on the surface or ice crystals in clouds.  (Percival Lowell, Mars,  Houghton, Mifflin, 
1897 ed., pp. 86–87) 
 
1894, July 20 — Sunset. Bernard Parry and his wife are near Marr iott [now Marriott -Slaterville], Utah, when they see a 
“small black cloud” in the northeast quickly approaching them. It grows bigger, then smaller, as they watch it. 
When it is only 450 feet away, it stops and hovers. Its sides seem to be folded up toward the center.  Many small 
black -and-white objects (birds?) are moving in its center. Suddenly the object pivots to the east and moves away 
toward Ogden. ( Ogden (Utah) Standard,  July 26, 1894)  
 
1894, Late November — 11:00 p.m. –2:00 a.m . Mennonite f armers Henry W. J. Smith  and Benjamin W. Blue  see a 
luminous ball in the northeastern sky about 30° above the horizon some 3 miles west of Manchester, Kansas. The 
object , in the shape of a “casket,”  shoots toward the west 3° then returns to its original position.  As it maneuvers 
near them, it opens several times, revealing various entities each time, from a crowned man to a “haughty 
woman” and a military leader. The original report appears in the Evangelical Visitor.  (“Battle in the Heavens, ”

1895 
 
1895  — French parapsychologist Albert de Rochas  is asked to hypnotize a family friend, “Mireille,” who is suffering 
from some ailment. In one of her sessions, Mireille describes how she is rising in space, which  she describes as 
luminous and peopled with phantoms. Subsequent sessions reveal that she has visited Mars and other planets  in 
astral form . Mars has canals, of course, but also Martians who are less intelligent than earthlings.  (Albert de 
Rochas, Les vies successives: Documents pour l’étude de cette question , Bibliothèque Chacomac, 1911; Hilary 
Evans, “ Martians of the 1890s, ” IUR 11, no. 5 (Sept./Oct. 1986): 8 –9) 
 
1895, August — US psychical researcher James Hyslop  begins investigating a case of automatic writing by Sarah Harper  
Cleaveland  (“Mrs. Smead ”) in On ondaga County, New York.  She keeps records of her planchette experiments 
and puts them at Hyslop ’s disposal. In August, she makes several references to the planet Mars and Jupiter. She 
provides a crude map of Jupiter ’s surface, and the planet is said to be the “babies ’ heaven. ” At the next sitting , she 
draws a  map of Mars, the different zones named in the Martian language ; she gives several communications about 
the inhabitants and the canals. Martian revelations cease for another 5 years until September 1900, when the 
communications return  in a developed state. She d raws m en, boats, houses, and flowers, named in Martian and 
written in hieroglyphic characters. Some of the sketches (a self -winding double clock) are very ingenious, while 
others (a M artian airship) are peculiar but unconvincing. (Hilary Evans, “ Martians of the 1890s, ” IUR 11, no. 5

1895, August 31 — 8:00 p.m. Oxford English Dictionary  lexicographer James Murray  watches a “brilliant luminous 
body ” move  slowly over the Oxford University campus in Oxford, England, toward the east. At roughly the same 
time, other observers  in London see a similar meteor pass over slowly for about 5 minutes , and A. Warren 
Melhuish sees it at Margate, Kent, around 10:15 p.m.  (J. A. H. Murray, “ Remarkable Meteoric (?) Appearance, ”

1896, Mid-July — Night. Chester N. Crotsenburg , a postal clerk on the Chicago, Rock Island, and Pacific Railway, is on a 
train heading north from Princeton, Missouri, when he notices a round, dull -rose-colored light low on the western 
horizon. It then rises in height to 45°, and appears to be pacing the train, keeping a half -mile or one mile distan ce. 
After the train reaches Lineville, Iowa (13.7 miles away), it passes out of sight behind buildings. Possibly the 
moon. ( “Ball Lightning,” Monthly Weather Review 26 (August 1898): 358; Martin Shough and Wim van Utrecht,

passengers . (US Patent, “ Air-ship, ” granted August 11, 1896)  
 
1896, October — Evening. A Miss Hagstrom  is riding a bicycle on Telegraph Avenue in Oakland, California, when she 
notices an object with a powerful headlight moving toward the west and gradually descending. ( “Saw the Mystic

1896, Early November? — Evening. Some of the employees at the Sutro Heights estate [now Sutro Heights Park in the 
Richmond District] of San Francisco , California,  belonging to Mayor Adol ph Sutro  watch a brilliant light 
approaching from the sea at a height of 500 feet. Two lights are visible, one a “misty -looking mass” and the other 
a searchlight. The object disappears in the direction of the city and turns to the north just before it passes from 
view.  Another report suggests that the object passe d over Seal Rocks and shone its searchlight on the seals.  (“The 
Apparition of the Air, ” San Francisco Call,  November 24, 1896, p. 1)  
1896, Early November — 8:00 p.m. Louis Charmak  and one other person in Woodland, California, notice three bright 
lights in the southwestern sky moving toward the northeast. As they reach Main Street, they rise another 100 feet 
in the air. They are close together and followed by a white trail of light.  (“Was It an Airship? ” Woodland (Calif.)

1896, November 17  — Afternoon  and evening . A mystery airship wave begins in California  when residents of the Oak 
Park neighborhood of Sacramento see a high -flying object moving slowly in a cir cle, leaving a trail of smoke. 
Around 6:30 p.m., a light resembling an electric arc lamp appears in the night sky above Sacramento. Horse 
trainer David Carl notice s it close to the ground and hears a voice saying, “We are too low down here. Send her 
up higher.” Hundreds watch as it passes at low altitude  for 30 minutes , avoiding buildings and hills. Some people 
claim to hear voices, either arguing or singing. R. L. Lowry sees four men pushing the vessel by its wheels. The 
witnesses include street car workers Charles Lusk and Granville  C. Snider , who watch the object  rise and fall as  it 
moves southwest.  (Wikipedia, “ Mystery airship ”; “Voices in the Sky, ” Sacrame nto (Calif.) Evening Bee,

1896, November 20 — Afternoon. D. H. Risdon is working in an orchard near Tagus, California, when he spots an  object 
“like an immense  sheet” moving against the wind at a “considerable elevation.” ( “Saw the Mystic Flying Light, ” 
San Francisco Call, November 22, 1896, p. 13)  
1896, November 2 0 — 5:30 p.m. Passengers on a streetcar in Oakland, California, notice a “peculiar -looking contrivance” 
high in the sky and moving in a westerly direction toward San Francisco. It has a powerful headlight and another 
light on the bottom.  It is also seen over Folsom, San Francisco, Sacramento, Modesto , Manteca , Sebastopol,  and 
several other cities later in the evening and is reportedly viewed by hundreds of witnesses.  (“Saw the Mystic 
Flying Light, ” San Francisco Call,  November 22, 1896, p. 13 ; Wikipedia, “ Mystery airship ”) 
1896, November 22 — San Francisco attorney George D. Collins  announces that he represents the airship inventor, a 
“very wealthy man who has been  studying  the subject of flying machines for fifteen years” and who moved to 
California from Maine in 1889. He claims the airship is a 150 -foot metal contraption with two canvas wings 18 
feet wide and shaped like a bird ’s tail.  It has been built in Oroville and is now hidden in the San Francisco , 
California,  area as the inventor deals with technical problems.  However, people in Oroville sense a hoax, as they know of no such inventor. On November 24, Collins complains to the San Francisco Call  that another newspaper, 
the San Francisco Examiner,  has been printing falsehoods about him, including an interview with another 
attorney, Frederick Bradley. Suspicion falls on an itinerant  dentist from Maine, E lmer H. Benjamin, who insists 
his only inventions are dental fittings. A prominent citizen of Oakland, George H. Carleton , claims to know the 
inventor but has been sworn to secrecy. Former California Attorney General William  H. H. Hart  soon claims to 
represent the mystery inventor, who has fired Collins for talking too much. But Hart is also blabbing prolifically, 
saying that two  or three  airships exist (a second built in an eastern state) and his role is to “consolidate both 
interests.” Hart asserts that the airship can carry four men and 1,000 pounds of dynamite for dropping on Havana,

when their horse stops suddenly. Looking up, they see three slender beings about 7 feet tall. Shaw walks up to 
them and asks them where they are from; they reply in an odd warbling language. He notes that they are hairless 
and wear no apparent clothing. The eyes are large and lustrous, and they each seem to be carrying an egg -shaped 
light and a breathing apparatus under the left arm.  Shaw claims  the beings try to lift him but they are not strong  
enough. They then notice a 150 -foot airship  hovering 20 feet above the water close to a bridge. The three beings 
float to the craft, open a door in the side, and disappear inside. The ship flies quickly out of sight. Shaw speculates 
that the beings are from Mars. ( “Three Strange Visitors, ” Stockton (Calif.) Evening Mail,  November 27, 1896, p.

1897, February –July — The m ystery airship wave continues, from  Nebraska and  Colorado to Texas and Ohio.  Hoaxes 
and pranks pollute the information pool in a major way during this era and the planet Venus and other celestial 
objects undoubtedly play a major role, but many airship reports emanate from manifestly sober, puzzled citizens, 
and they continue long after the initial excitement subsides. To all appearances, they are objects of some kind, but 
since newspapers rarely question witnesses critically about detai ls at this time , little can be deduced from the mass 
of reports.  (Loren E. Gross, The Mystery of Unidentified Flying Objects —A Prelude, 1896 –1949 , The author,

1897, April 17 — 6:00 a.m. An airship is said to collide with the tower of Judge James  Spencer  Proctor ’s windmill in 
Aurora, Texas, causing it to explode and strew debris over several acres. The pilot (reported ly “not of this world,” 
or a “Martian ” according to a n alleged Army  Signal Service officer named Thomas  Jefferson  Weem s from 
nearby  Fort Worth ), does not survive the crash and is buried  “with  Christian rites ” at the Aurora Cemetery. 
Wreckage from the crash site is either dumped into a nearby well located under the damaged windmill  or ends up 
with the alien in the grave. Adding to the mystery is the story of Brawley Oates,  who purchase s Judge Proctor ’s 
property around 1935. Oates clean s out the debris from the well in order to use it as a water source, but later 
develop s an extremely severe case of  rheumatoid arthritis , which he claim s is the result of contaminated water 
from the wreckage dumped into the well. As a result, Oates seal s up the well with a concrete slab and place s an 
outbuilding on the spot in 1945. The entire yarn is widely regarded as a hoax , although Proctor ’s windmill 
apparently did exist . (Wikipedia, “ Aurora, Texas, UFO incident ”; “A Windmill Demolishes It,” Dallas Morning

1899  
 
1899  — Serbian -American inventor Nikola Tesla  is working in his laboratory near Colorado Springs , Colorado,  when he 
observe s unusual signals from his receiver that he speculate s are communications from another planet. He 
mention s them in a letter to a reporter in December 189 9 and to the  Red Cross Society  in December 1900 . 
Reporters treat  it as a sensational story and jump  to the conclusion Tesla is hearing signals from  Mars . In 1901, 
Tesla writes that it has not been immediately apparent to him that he is hearing “intelligently controlled signals ” 
and that the signals could have come from Mars,  Venus , or other planet s. It is possible that he is intercept ing 
Guglielmo Marconi ’s European experiments in July 1899 —Marconi may have transmitted the letter S (dot  dot

another experimenter in wireless transmission ; or “whistlers,” very low frequency radio waves generated by 
lightning flashes . Brian Dunning  of the  Skeptoid  podcast attributes Tesla ’s signals to  pulsars , which are not 
identified until 1968.  (Nikola Tesla, “ Talking with the Planets, ” Colliers Weekly  26 (February 9, 1901): 4 –5;

1899  — Swiss psychologist Carl Jung  investigates  his 15 -year-old cousin, Hélène Preiswerk  (“S.W.”), in Basel, 
Switzerland, who claims to be a spiritualist medium.  Her trances frequently involve journeys to other planets. She 
claims that Martians have flying machines, and they irrigate the land with canals and artificial lakes. ( Hilary 
Evans, “ Martians of the 1890s, ” IUR 11, no. 5 (Sept./Oct. 1986): 7 –8)  
1899, Mid-January — Late night. People returning from a dance near McMahan, Texas, see a group of stars in formation, 
moving in one direction. A few miles further east , hunters camping on a hilltop see the full outline of an airship 
with headlights and windows. ( Dallas (Tex.) News,  January 25, 1899; Clark III 86)  
1899, January 26 — 11:00 p.m. People outside the opera house in McAlester, Oklahoma, watch an airship “like a railway 
car suspended from a large balloon -like arrangement” pass overhead. It shines a bright searchlight a long the 
ground. ( [News note ], Garfield Cou nty (Okla.) Democrat,  February 9, 1899, p. 4)  
 
1899, June 1 — Late evening. Observers in Kamen -Rybolov, Primorsky Krai, Russia, see a blue sphere about 28 inches in 
diameter flying silently from south to north near the steamboat Kazak Ussuriyskiy  moored on Lake Khanka. It is 
seen for 20 minutes , then it returns later in the evening flying north to south at greater speed, disappearing 11 
minutes later. (Stonehill and Mantle, Russia’s USO Secrets,  Flying Disk, 2020, p. 113)  
 
1899, July 4 — 4:30 p.m. A mystery balloon floats across the sky in Spokane, Washington, from southwest to northeast. 
Before it disappears, it ascends so high that “nothing but a small black ball far up in the heavens could be 
discerned.” ( “Who Owns the Big Balloon? ” Spokane (Wash.) Chronicle,  July 5, 1899, p. 2)  
 
1899, October — Midnight. Physician Malcom McKinnon is driving home to Fosston, Minnesota, in his carriage when a 
dazzling ball of white light crosses the road ahead about one-quarter of a mile away, lighting up the road like 
daylight. It resembles an electric arc lamp and moves slowly from north to southeast about 3 feet above the 
ground, throwing the field furrows into visible relief. As it passes closer, McKinnon sees tha t it is clearly “disk 
shaped, about the size of an umbrella.” It is in sight for 30 minutes. ( Minneapolis Minnesota Journal,  October 25, 
1899; Chris Aubeck and Martin Shough, Return to Magonia: Investigating UFOs in History,  Anomalist, 2015,

1900  — Psychic medium Catherine -Elise Müller  (under the pseudonym “Hélène Smith”) of Geneva, Switzerland, 
becomes famous with the publication of  Des Indes à la Planete Mars  (From  India  to the Planet  Mars ) 
by Théodore Flournoy , professor of  psychology  at the  University of Geneva . The medi um and the psychologist 
remain  very close until 1 900, when the book i s first published , document ing her various series of somnambulatory 
trances in which she experiences a civilization on Mars and her former lives : the “Martian ” cycle, “Ultram artian” 
cycle, “ Hindu ,” “Oriental ,” and “royal” cycles. She writes out the Martian communications on paper and 
translates them into French, popularizing automatic  writing. ( Society for Psychical Research, PSI Encyclopedia, 
“Hélène Smith ”; Hilary Evans, “Martians of the 1890s, ” IUR 11, no. 5 (Sept./Oct. 1986): 4 –6)

1901, Summer — Day. A 10 -year-old boy is walking home to Bournbrook, West Midlands, England , through a path 
behind his family ’s garden when he comes upon a large box-shaped device with a small, centrally placed turret. 
The only opening is a door, through which two small men (less than 4 feet tall) in military uniforms (but no 
insignia), each wearing an odd -looking cap with a wire sticking up on both sides, step out. One stays by the door, but the other walks toward the boy and waves him away. The beings go back in the craft, a b right flash surrounds 
it, and it shoots into the air with a whooshing sound. (Clark III 261; Jenny Randles and Philip Barnet,

is taking meteorological observations with a colleague when they see a “brilliant globular light” in t he south -
southeast at about 42° e levation. When it is nearly overhead, it appears elongated and takes “an elliptical form.” It 
moves slowly north and remains visible for 4 minutes, covering about 20 ° of arc. It disappears above the northern 
horizon. (Bill Chalker, “ Early Australian Historical Encounters, ” 1997)

1903, March 17 — Mid-evening. Madge Brosius,  12, and her father Charles  see a “huge object like a gigantic ripe 
cucumber with slightly tapered ends” over the family farm in Helmer, Indiana.  Its inside is illuminated,  and it has 
8 windows in two rows of four each . Her father estimates it is 100 feet long.  It begins moving away from him as 
he moves toward it, zigzagging like a child ’s balloon losing air.  (Madge Brosius Allyn, “The Flying Cucumber of 
1903,” Fate 24, no. 3  (March 1971 ): 45–47; Clark III 1162 ) 
 
1903, September 29 –October 3  —An implement dealer name d U. G. Griffith  is on his way home in Van Meter, Iowa . As 
he approache s, he notices  a strange point of light like a spotlight emanating from the top of the Mather & Gregg ’s 
building . He approaches cautiously, but the light sails across the street. He tells others about the experience, and 
over the next few days  several people report a half -human, half -animal entity with large bat -like wings.  The 
townsfolk chase the creature to  a local mine shaft, down which it disappears, never to be seen again. (“A Winged

1904  — Late afternoon. Wirt M. Covert , 17, and Arthur B. Eldert  are returning on horseback from a grocery store in 
Dixboro, Michigan, when they see a large object in the air moving west behind the steeple of the Dixboro United 
Methodist Church. He compares its shape to the Confederate ironclad Virginia  and it has a thick mast sticking up 
from its center and orange light shining through some windows. Suddenly  it rises at about a 60° angle over the 
hills, tipping its mast back,  and disappears.  (NICAP case file)  
 
1904, February 28 — Mid-evening. The steamer USS Supply  is transporting the ill Governor of Guam, William Elbridge 
Sewell,  from Guam to San Francisco , California . About 300 miles west -southwest of San Francisco, commanding 
Lt. Frank Herman Schofield  observes three objects “beneath the clouds, their color a rather bright red.”  As they approach the ship they appear to soar, passing above the broken clouds. After rising above the clouds, they appear 
to “be moving directly away from the earth.  The largest had an apparent area of about six suns.  It was egg -shaped, 
the larger end forward. Th e second was about twice the size of the sun, and the third, about the size of the sun. 
Their near approach to the surface appeared to be most remarkable.” The objects are in sight for over two minutes 
by three people.  Barry Gre enwood  thinks they are meteors, but Bruce Maccabee  is not so sure. ( “Meteors Fly

1904, June — 10:00 p.m. When To ny Darby goes outside to the well on his farm 5 miles north of Rolling Prairie, Indiana, 
he notices two round, orange -colored , silent  objects  hovering 5 –6 feet from the ground near the barn. He 
estimates they are the size of wagon wheels. One of the objects is 2 feet behind and to the left of the other. 
Running back to the house, he calls for his mother and brother, and all three walk toward th e objects, which move 
away slightly then stop when the witnesses stop. Soon the obje cts move steadily away to the northeast, still 
maintaining their relative positions, at about the speed of a man walking. They pause briefly in a small hollow, 
then continue o ver a small hill and out of sight. (Lore and Deneault, pp. 91–92) 
 
1905  
 
1905  — Frederick Spencer Oliver ’s book A Dweller on Two Planets  is published posthumously. It is  a narrative 
channeled by Oliver in Yreka, California, through automatic writing and mental dictations by a spirit calling itself 
Phylos the Tibetan, an Atlantean who reveal s his story from 1883 to 1886. The book de als with deep esoteric 
subjects including  karma  and reincarnation  and describes Phylos ’s final incarnation in 19th century America 
where his Atlantean karma play s itself out. In that incarnation (as Walter Pierson, gold miner and occult student 
of the Theo -Christic Adepts) he travels to Venus in an astral body while his physical form remains at a temple 
inside  Mount Shasta, California . (Wikipedia, “ A Dweller on Two Planets ”; Frederick Spencer Oliver, A Dweller

1905, August 3  — 1:30 a.m. Farmer John A. Jackson is driving a herd of hogs from Silsbee (a former settlement 6 miles 
southwest of El Centro) to Imperial, California, when a bright light flash es on him from above. He is momentarily 
blinded, and the hogs start running away. Jackson sees it is a searchlight from an ai rship about 100 feet long and 
propelled by wings that move up and down. It has smaller lights along the side s. Jackson wake s up W. E. Wilsie, 
who lives nearby, and they watch it disappear to the northeast. Anothe r farmer, A. J. Morey, also glimpses the 
airship. ( “Aerial Navigation in Imperial Valley, ” Imperial (Calif.) Press,  August 5, 1905, p. 4)  
 
1906  
 
1906  — Herbert Vern DeMott,  10, watches  an object come down near his  family ’s water well in Mitchel l, South Dakota. 
As he approaches it, a door rolls back and he is welcomed ins ide by two human -like occupants who are sitting 
inside on camp stools. They converse with him fluently, but he does not know where they c ome from. He sees a 
lever that apparently can cut off the earth ’s “magnetism,” allowing the object to rise. The occupants take water 
from the farm ’s horse trough to be “used in making electricity.” ( “DeMott Rock Study Crosses Continents, ” 
Albany (Oreg.) Democrat -Herald,  August 27, 1973, p. 11; Clark III 261; Patrick Gross, URECAT , July 22, 2009)  
 
1906, January 4 — Night. Martin Meyer son is on the beach at Paia, Maui, Hawaii, when he sees a green object with the 
shape and diameter of the full moon appear from behind the southern slopes of the Wailuku Mountains. It is so 
bright it illuminates the cane fields below, then travels like a “slo w-pitched baseball” and disappears behind 
Mount Haleakala to the southeast. (Clark III 1168)  
 1906, September 16 — Late afternoon. Hundreds of people in Indianapolis , Indiana,  see a “cigar -shaped object” like an 
airship pass over the city. It is seen first in Irvington and then floats over the southern side of the business district 
where it is distinctly seen from downtown. Some estimate it to be 2,000 feet in the air; the watc hman at the 
courthouse tower looks at it through binoculars but cannot see any detail. It disappears to t he west. ( “Ship 
Founders in Air, ” Indianapolis Star,  September 17, 1906, p. 1)  
 
1906, October 7 — 5:00 p.m . An airship again floats over the southeastern portion of Indianapolis , Indiana,  and is seen by 
many as it turns northeast and disappears in the distance. ( “Ship Floats over City: Hundreds See It in Flight ,”

1906, November — Dusk. Roy Russell and four other cotton -pickers are taking a br ief respite from work 10 miles 
southeast of Anadarko, Oklahoma, when they see a fiery object shaped like a stovepipe. From an initial altitude of 
60 feet, the object sinks down, comes toward them, and passes within 16 feet at eye level. Then it seems to fla tten 
out and just blacks out. Another similar object follows and then several others. Russell watches them for 20 
minutes. ( “Recalls Fiery 1906 U.F.O., ” Des Moines (Iowa) Tribune, May 4, 1966, p. 36)  
 
1907  
 
1907, April 20 –26 — The Nashville American  prints some tall tales  about encounters with occupants of a balloon who 
land briefly in various places (usually near a spring) around central Tennessee. The witnesses include a  farmer 
named W. A. Smith , Walter Stephenson, Herman Schubert, Asa Hickerson, and A. Mollycoddle.  The aeronauts 
are dressed strangely, play music, and speak a foreign language. (Nashville  (Tenn.)  Sunday American,  April 21 –

Tennessee Aeronaut Flap of 1907,” Fortean  Times  313 (May 2014 ): 28–29) 
 
1907, Summer  — While playing along the shore of a lake near Vilppula  [now Mänttä -Vilppula] , Finland, a group of boys 
see a light come from over the water and settle on the beach nearby. A door opens, and human -like beings 
emerge, sending the youths running. Searchers who come to the site later find traces and footprints. (Clark III 
261; Center for UFO Studies, HUMCAT Index 1900 -1909,  p. 7) 
1907, July 2 — Just before 12:00 noon. Bishop John Stephen Michaud  is talking with Vermont ex -governor Urban A. 
Woodbury  at the corner of Church and College streets in Burlington, Vermont, when they hear a loud explosion 
and see a torpedo -shaped object about 6 feet long and 8 inches in diameter suspended in the air about 300 feet 
away. It is dark, with several tongues of fl ame issuing from it at various points, as if its covering is ruptured. It 
slowly begins to move to the southeast. The explosion has either knocked down or stunned a horse in College 
Street. A strong downpour of rain ensues shortly afterward. Although described as a “possible case of ball 
lightning,” the object appears more likely to have been a n exploded  balloon  that someone has attached fireworks 
to in preparation for a Fourth of July celebration. ( “Saw Ball of Fire, ” Burlington (Vt.) Free Press,  July 3, 1907, p. 
7; William H. Alexander, “ A Possible Case of Ball Lightning, ” Monthly Weather Review  35 (July 1907): 310 –

1907, July 7 — 6:40 p.m. W. E. Thomas is watching a vivid sunset in Phoenix, Arizona, when he sees a “blue disk 
floating in the heavens apparently close to the sun.” It passes in front of the sun, completely covering it. Other 
discs appear until there are seven  of them. His wife also sees the objects, which are constantly in motion, 
changing directions and sometimes moving in a straight -line formation. The disks are visible for another hour 
until sunset, when they are last seen as blue blotches. ( “Phoenix Man Sees Blue Stars, ” Tucson (Ariz.) Citizen,  
July 11, 1907, p. 4)  
 
1908  
 
1908, March 30 — 10:15 p.m. F. W. Longbottom in Queens Park, Chester, England , is photographing the Whirlpool 
Galaxy (NGC 5194) in Canes Venacti with a 12.25 -inch reflector. When the plate is developed, it shows an 
unknown nebulous object some 25 minutes of arc northeast of the galaxy. He does not see the object when he 
examines the same spot again on April 6. (F. W. Longbottom, “ Comet or ——— ?” The Observatory  31 (1908): 
215–216)  
1908, May — Late evening. Helen C. Peterson sees a string of lighted beads in the sky over Great River, Long Island, 
New York. The first light stops and as the others reach it , they seem to bump into it . It grows a little bigger, 
appearing like a large star. Suddenly it begins to spin like a pinwheel, but without sparks. The motion stops and 
what looks like a very bright star takes off at great speed toward the southeast. (Clark III 1168 –1169)  
 
1908, June 30 — 7:14 a.m. A large explosion takes place near the Podkamennaya Tunguska River in Yeniseysk 
Governorate [now Krasnoyarsk Krai ], Russia. Evenki natives and Russian settlers in the hills northwest of Lake 
Baikal observe a column of bluish light, nearly as bright as the sun, moving across the sky. About 10 minutes 
later, there is a flash and a sound similar to artillery fire. Eyewit nesses closer to the explosion report that the 
source of the sound moves from the east to the north of them. The sou nds are accompanied by a shock wave that 
knocks people off their feet and breaks windows hundreds of kilometers away. The explosion over the sparsely 
populated eastern Siberian taiga flattens 770 square miles of forest and possibly causes up to three human  
casualties. The event is generally attributed to the air burst of a meteoroid. It is classified as an impact event, even 
though no impact crater has been found. The object disintegrates at an altitude of 3 –6 miles rather than hit ting the 
surface of the Ea rth. The area is so remote that the site is not inspected until 1927 by a team led by Russian 
mineralogist Leonid Kulik , who finds a zone about 5 miles across where trees are scorched and devoid of 
branches but still standing upright. More exotic explanations for the event include a black hole impact, antimatter, 
a UFO crash (as recently as 2004 by Russian ufologist Yuri Labvin), a nuclear explosion, and an inadvertent 
experiment by Nikola Tesla . (Wikipedia, “ Tunguska event ”; Hobana and Weverbergh  10–30; John Baxter  and

1908, Summer — Repeated sightings of unidentified airships, sometimes flying against the wind, take place in Denmark. 
They usually have wings and searchlights; on one occasion, an antenna is seen jutting from the front end. Other 
reports are of oddly shaped clou ds from which a searchlight emanates, sweeping the ground. ( Willy Wegner, “ The 
Mystery ‘Airship ’ over Denmark in 1908, ” The UFO  Register  8, no. 1 (November 1977): 3 –8; Clark  III 1163)  
1908, July 25 — About 6:00 p.m. A “large airship sailing very high” is seen passing from north to south over the 
Forestville neighborhood of Bristol, Connecticut. It seems to be an elongated gas bag under which a framework 
with a propeller is suspended. After “maneuvering” a while, it st ops and circles over Lake Compounce then 
changes course toward the southwest.  An East Bristol man named Wilson later claims it was a pig -shaped balloon 
he had sent up for his daughter ’s birthday party , but “balloon” sighting s continue in Massachusetts through 
December . (“Large Airship Seen Sailing over East Part of Bristol, Ct.,” Boston Herald,  July 2 6, 1908, p. 16 ; “The

1908, October — Skipper J. H. Stockman of the smack Superb  is fishing in the North Sea 35 miles out of Lowestoft, 
Suffolk, England , when he sees a large “star” rise out of the water and approach his ship. He signals it with a red 
flare, and to his surprise he is immediately answered with a red flare above him. He then shows a white flare and 
receives a blue flare in response. The object appears sausage -shaped and carries a single light. It disappears in the 
direction of the Netherlands. ( East Anglian Daily Times,  May 20, 1909; Norfolk News,  May 22, 1909; Clark III

1909  
 
1909  — Night. Frederick G. Hehr  sees a bright white light executing a “curious dance” over a village one mile awa y in 
East Frisia, Lower Saxony, Germany. A minute later the light suddenly streaks in his direction, coming within 300 feet as it passes by at 60 feet altitude. Three seconds later it is gone. (“Report from the Readers,” Fate 4, no. 5

1909, March 4 — 8:25 p.m. Charles Maberly, an organist at St. Michael ’s Church in Lambourne, Berkshire, England , is 
returning home from choir practice when he sees a bright searchlight attached to a torpedo -shaped dirigible 
heading west at 200 feet altitude. He walks for about 50 yards watching it. As it passes out of sight, he hears three 
explosions at regular intervals. (London Evening News,  May 18, 1909;  Carl Grove, “ The Airship Wave of 1909:

overhead just above treetop level. It carries a searchlight that illuminates the road, farm buildings, trees, and 
everything it touches. (“Mystery of the Air,” London  Daily Express,  May 14, 1909, p. 1; David Clarke,

they hear a loud explosion in the air followed by the rumbling o f an engine. Allen sees an oblong dark shape, 
perhaps 100 feet long, with lights in front and behind moving at an altitude of 500 –600 feet. They dimly perceive 
some men on a platform below it. It passes out of sight at 20 mph northeast toward Peterborough. ( East Anglian

“large dark object looming out of the sky” and traveling slowly from the east. After a few seconds it remains 
nearly stationary for a few minutes in front of her window , and she sees the outline of a torpedo -shaped airship 
about 1,300 feet in altitude. It rises higher then travels swiftly to the we st toward London. It shows two powerful 
searchlights at each end very briefly. (London Evening News , May 15, 1909;  Carl Grove, “ The Airship Wave of

1909, May 17 — The subject of mystery airships is brought up in a debate in the House of Commons. Arthur Fell , MP for 
Great Yarmouth, England, had asked Secretary of State for War Richard Haldane  if he could give the number of 
dirigibles, either built or in progress of being built, in Germany. Haldane replies that 7 dirigible airships have been 
built and another 5 are under construction. Horatio Myer , MP for Lambeth North, follows up by as king Haldane: 
“Will the honourable gentleman, in any report he may circulate, tell us about a certain dirigible supposed to be 
hovering about our coast?” The question is greeted with laughter and Haldane does not reply. (Neil R. Storey,

“spring c art” from Senghenydd  on his way home to Cardiff, South Wales. At the summit of Caerphilly Mountain 
he se es a long, tube -shaped object sitting on the grass by the roadside, with two men busily working on 
something. They are wearing heavy fur coats and fur caps that fit tightly over the heads. Lethbridge proceeds to 
about 60 feet of them when they notice him a nd start jumping up and jabbering in a foreign language. They quickly pick up something from the ground, then jump into a little carriage suspended from the object (with 
wheels at the bottom), which rises into the air in a zig -zag fashion. When it clears the telegraph wires, two electric 
lights shine out and the craf t heads toward the southeast. Lethbridge returns to the site with a newspaper reporter 
and they find signs of trampling in the grass for about 45 feet. They also pick up a small red French military label, 
letterhead from a London stockbroker , many newspape r clippings with references to airships or the German army, 
and a tin box with paste for polishing metal. ( “Airship Mystery, ” The Guardian  (London), May 20 , 1909 , p. 7 ;

Cardiff, Wales, sees a cigar -shaped object flying swiftly at perhaps 2,600 feet and making a whizzing noise. It has 
two lights and is movi ng eastward. Some dock workers who are loading the SS Arndale  also see the object for “a 
minute or two .” It passes over the Bristol Channel towards Weston -super -Mare.  Aeronaut Percival G. Spencer  
says that he recently sold several of his “man -lifting” 25 -foot-long model airships to advertis ing firms in the UK, 
one of them in Cardiff.  (London Globe,  May 19, 1909;  Brett Holman, “ Wednesday, 19 May 1909, ” Airminded,

1909, July–August — A mystery airship  wave begins in New Zealand with numerous sightings of unusual nocturnal 
lights and airships seen in both daytime and nighttime. The sightings are at first most intense over the southern 
end of South Island. In the following weeks the reports appear to move northward and by August, Australia also 
falls under the grip of what press accounts call “aerialitis.” ( “The ‘Lights’ in the Sky, ” Melbourne (Vic.) Argus,

1909, August 9 — 7:30–8:00 p.m. A flying object with lights on its f ront and back sails at a great altitude from west to 
east over Concord, New Hampshire, eventually disappearing into a cloud. Capt. Lyman Jackman  at first thinks it 
is a balloon, but its estimated speed of 45 –50 mph against the wind leads him to think otherwise. ( “Air Ship or 
Meteor,” Concord (N.H.) Evening Monitor,  August 10, 1909, p. 3)  At about the same time, Bertha Niles of Vale 
Perkins, Quebec,  watches a similar lighted object moving west to east. ( “Air Ship or What?” Concord (N.H.)

north. Through a telescope, the object looks like an inverted top. The lower portion is lighted, and as it revolves, a 
small light turns on the land  beneath. It continues drifting northward . (Bill Chalker, The Oz Files,  Duffy and 
Snellgrove, 1996, p. 31)  1909, August 18 — 2:30 a.m. Four men (Capt. Edward P. Sisson, Ernest T. Newton, Prentice Lanphear, and Edwar d M. 
Knapp) at the Coast Guard life -saving station on the south side of Fishers Island, New York, see a winged airship 
60 feet long and 20 feet wide. Moving swiftly against the wind, it moves in from the northeast, its engines

1909, September — 7:30 p.m. E. B. Hanna of South Windham, Connecticut, watches a high -flying, meandering 
“searchlight” along Windham Center Road for about an hour. After heading toward him, it changes direction and 
moves southward. ( “What Mr. Hanna Saw May Have Been the Worcester Airship,” Willimantic (Conn.) 
Chronicle,  December 14, 1909, p. 8)  
1909,  September 1 — 4:30 p.m. A cigar -shaped object is seen maneuvering at Gore, New Zealand, gradually disappear ing

1909, September 20 — During the opposition of Mars, astronomer  Eugène Antoniadi  uses the 83cm aperture telescope 
at Meudon Observatory  in Paris , France,  to observe Mars . He sees no canals. The outstanding photos of Mars 
taken at the new Baillaud dome at the  Pic du Midi  Observatory in the French Pyrenees also bring formal discredit 
to the Martian canal theory, and the notion of canals begins to fall out of favor. Around this time, spectroscopic 
analysis also begins to show that no water is present in the Martian atmosphere. (Wikipedia, “ Martian canal ”) 
1909, September 30 — Evening. A balloon “supposed to be from Chicago” passes over Edinburgh, Indiana. Its anchor 
somehow gets entangled  in high -tension wires of the traction station for the Indianapolis, Columbus, and Southern 
interurban rail. It move s south to Taylorsville a few minutes later, and it is so low to the ground that the occupants 
are able to talk to passersby. ( “Tramp Balloon Snaps Wires, ” Indianapolis Star,  October 1, 1909, p. 9)  
 
1909, October — 10:30 p.m. Rev. Ruth Smith  and some church members are riding in a wagon in La Porte, Indiana, when 
the horses rear and a blinding light splashes across the road. A large structure resembling two inverted bowls, 
separated by a row of lights, is hovering, with several phosphorescent  beams extending to the ground. It is 
encircled in a corona of light  and begins moving slowly. After 15 minutes, it blinks out.  (Lore and Deneault , p. 
97; Clark III 1169 ) 
 
1909, December 13 — 10:00 p.m. A. W. Norris of Mabelvale, Arkansas, sees a bright, bobbling light  moving through the 
air about 300 feet above him from the south. ( “Airship Flies near Little Rock, Perhaps, ” Little Rock Arkansas 
Gazette,  December 15, 1909, p. 7)  
1909, December 22 — 6:30 p.m. Many r esidents of Worcester, Massachusetts, see a “brilliant ray” emitted by a large 
black object 1,000 feet high in the southwestern sky . After circling over the town, the object heads to the west, 
where it is seen over Marlboro. It returns to Worcester between 7 :00 and 7:30 p.m., flying at low altitude and 
sporting a searchlight. One policeman thinks he sees enormous wings; others detect one or two figures inside.  The 
airship is attributed to a Worcester businessman named Wallace E. Tillinghast,  who has told the Boston Herald  on 
December 12  that he has invented a h eavier -than-air mono plane and has made more than 100 test flights at night 
to Boston and New York City. But Tillinghast never offers his aircraft for public viewing, and people gradually 
realize it is a hoax.  (“Tells of Flight 30 Miles in Air,” Boston Herald,  December 13, 1909, p. 1;  “Tillinghast to His

1909, December 23 — 6:00 p.m. Charles F. Flynt  and several other people in Augusta, Maine, see a brilliantly lighted 
object moving from northeast to southwest when he is leaving his office at the newspaper. It is balloon -shaped, 
taller than it is wide. They watch it until it almost disappears. Flynt s ees it again about one hour later near his 
residence on East Crescent Street. Flashes of light, apparently moving up and down, come from the object as it 
gradually settles down around Betsy Howard Hill. It swings around in the sky and moves in a different direction 
before it disappears again to the southwest, perhaps as far away as Lewiston. Some observers claim to see two 
wings and two lights, one in the rear and another shining on the wings. Horace E. Bowditch  thinks it is diamond -
shaped. (“ Strange Object Passes over Augusta Early Thursday Evening, ” Augusta Daily Kennebec Journal ,

1909,  December 23 — 6:00–10:00 p.m. An airship is seen flying over Worcester, Massachusetts, and several nearby 
towns. Thousands of residents pour into the streets, bringing Worcester to a temporary standstill. P. D. Donahue 
of Baltic, Connecticut, says he could see two men in the vessel. After a sighting in Willimantic, Connecticut, the 
mayor says there is no doubt but that it was an airship.” Thousands of citizens of Boston , Massachusetts,  and 
neighboring communities see an airship with lights flying at a n altitude of around 400 feet.  Alex Randall of 
Revere reports wings, tail, and propeller, but other observers only see a cylindrical shape at most.  C. D. Rawson 
of Worcester later claims he had attached small lanterns and a reflector to the legs of large owls and was 
responsible for the sightings.  (“Skyship of Mystery Flies above Boston,” Boston Journal,  December 24, 1909,

Maryland, w hen he sees a metallic, brown, blimplike object, more than 100 feet long, hovering above a pine tree 
200 feet away. It has a row of colored, rectangular windows. Through one he can see as many as 20 strange 
entities taking turns looking at him. Their heads  are pointed , and they are dressed in light -colored garments with a 
fur-like texture. Each has small dots for eyes and a slit for a mouth. Two other young men also see the object and

dismounts and w alks the horse into a clearing, where he sees a row of lights a few feet above the ground.  They are 
attached to a huge, hovering disc. After watching it a while, he steps toward it, and it makes a buzzing sound as if 
in warning. As he advances, it rise s slowly into the sky until it reaches an altitude of several hundred feet, when it 
suddenly streaks off to the north.  (Clark III 1169)  
 
1910, October 25 — 5:30 p.m. A mystery airship is seen at Minderoo Station, Western Australia, by Mrs. A. J. Roe, wife 
of the station manager. She says it “looked compact, like a dirigible balloon, but it appeared to be squarer and 
more like an aeroplane. The su n shone on it, and flashes came from it, as though reflected from something 
revolving, or from metal work.” Three station hands also see the object. ( “Mysterious Airship Sighted at

Lieut. Raymond Fitzmaurice . Some can see an aerial light thought to belong to a dirigible. Nearby at Eastchurch, 
residents light flares to guide the craft in case it needs to land. The incident comes up in a debate in Parliament on 
November 21. MP William Joynson -Hicks  asks First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill  whether the 
government has any zeppelins capable of traveling at 60 mph, but Churchill answers no.  However, some 
authorities conclude that the incident is caused by the intru sion of the LZ 13 Hansa  Zeppelin  over British 
airspace. (“The German Airship over Sheerness, ” The Aeroplane  3 (November 14, 1912): 497; “The Alleged Visit

1913, February 5 — Evening. Numerous witnesses in Newport, Cardif f, and Neath, South Wales, watch a “dirigible” 
carrying a bright light pass in a northwesterly direction.  Newspapers begin to suspect that the reports are actually 
of the planet Venus, fire balloons, or atmospheric illusions.  (“The ‘Mysterious Airship, ’” Manchester Guardian ,

Holman, “ Thursday, 6 February 1913, ” Airminded, February 6, 2013)  
1913, February 9 — 9:00 p.m. An earth -grazing meteor  procession is seen from locations across Canada, the northeastern 
United States, and Bermuda, and from many ships at sea, including eight off Brazil, giving a total recorded 
ground track of over 7,000 miles. The meteors are particularly unusual in that there is no apparent r adiant —no 
point in the sky from which the meteors appear to originate. Witnesses are surprised to see a procession of 
between 40 and 60 bright, slow -moving fireballs moving from horizon to horizon in a practically identical pat h. 
Individual fireballs are visible for at least 30 to 40 seconds, and the entire procession t akes some 5 minutes to 
cross the sky. Subsequent observers also note a large, white, tail less body bringing up the rear, but the various 
bodies making up the procession  continue  to disintegrate and travel at different rates throughout their course, so 
that by the time observations are made in Bermuda, the leading bodies are described as “like large arc lights in 
appearance, slightly violet in colour ,” followed closely by yellow and red fragmen ts. Research carried out in the 
1950s by Alexander D. Mebane  uncover s a handful of reports from newspaper archives in the northern United 
States. At Escanaba, Michigan, the Press  states the “end of the world was apprehended by many ” as numerous 
meteors travel  across the northern horizon. In Batavia, New York , a few observers see  the meteors and many 
people hear  a thunderin g noise, while other reports ar e made in Nunda and Dansville, New York (where several 
residents again th ink the world is ending) and Osceola, Pennsylvania. The observations are analyzed in detail later 
in 1913  by the astronomer Clarence Chant,  leading him to conclude that as all accounts are positioned along a 
great circle arc, the source is a small, short -lived natural satellite of the Earth. One curious feature of the reports, 
highlighted by Mebane, is that several appear to indicate a second meteor procession on the same course around 5 
hours later, although the Earth ’s rotation mean s that there is no obvious mechanism to explain this. One observer, 
A. W. Brown from Thamesville, Ontario , reports  seeing both the initial meteor procession and a second one on 
the same course at 2:20 a.m. the next day. C hant’s original report also refer s to a series of three groups of “dark 
objects ” that pass on the same course as the previous meteors  from west to east over Toronto on the afternoon of 
February 10, which he suggest s are “something of a meteoric nature .” (Wikipedia, “ 1913 Great Meteor

1913, February 21 — Evening. An airship is seen at several locations around Selby, North Yorkshire, England . It 
alternately flies and hove rs, flashing a searchlight and skirting the roofs of houses before vanishing to the north at 
“great speed.” A t one point a group of businessme n waiting for a train at the Church Fenton railway station are 
treated to the sight of a p owerful searchlight running along the tracks.  Other wit nesses hear the whir of motors as

south of Potsdam until early morning but find nothing.  Though the women are co nsidered trustworthy, they are 
accused later of hoaxing the report.  Later, airman Lt. Zwickau claims that he was firing rockets while flying from 
Leipzig to Döberitz in order to see his way in the night.  (“An Airship Catastrophe near Potsdam?” Berliner

barking and howling. The boys stop work and go to investigate. They see a little man, dark green in color and 18 
inches high, who “looked like he was sitting on something.” His arms are hanging down by his sides. He has a 
Mexican -looking hat on, but no other clothes. Right after the boys get there, the two dogs jump him and tear him 
to pieces. Blood and internal organs spew out, but it doesn ’t cry out. The boys go back and check the spot the next 
day, but the remains are gone. (Clark III 262; Patrick Gross, URECAT , October 19, 2006)

1914, September 9 — Mid-day. Amateur astronomer William Herbert Steavenson  points his 3 -inch refracting telescope in 
West Norwood, south London, England, at the planet Mercury, then about 8° distant from the Sun, when a round, 
luminous object the apparent size of the planet, but brighter, speeds across his field, passing centrally from south 
to north in about 3 seconds. A few seconds later, another appears going in the same direction. More follow, and 
the display continues until at least 3:00 p.m. when the sky becomes overcast . He watches several hundred bodies 
pass; about half are perfectly round and the rest are dumbbell  shaped. All the objects ar e well defined and 
intrinsically brighter than Venus. The prevailing color is yellowish white. Steavenson sends a telegram  to the Rev. 
T. E. R. Phillips  at Ashstead, Surrey, but the sky is now overcast and he cannot confirm the observation. 
Steavensen thinks high -altitude seeds are the most likely explanation. ( W. H. Steavenson, “Bright Objects 
Observed near the Sun, ” Journal of the British Astronomical Association  25 (1914):  36–38)

suddenly vanishes. The office rs have been investigating reports of similar lights seen in the region during the 
summer. In December, GHQ Home Forces issues a 16 -page confidential report on the investigation and concludes 
there is “no evidence on which to base a suspicion that this class of enemy activi ty ever existed” and that 89% of 
the reports are explained. Some “moving lights in the air” are attributed to marsh gas. (Nick Redfern, “ UFOs and

about 3.7 miles west of Kurkieki  (now in the Russian Republic of Karelia)  and near a lake named Kankaanlampi , 
sees a large machine shaped like a wash basin land near her house. Small creatures, which she describes as devils, 
emerge from it by ladder. Somehow she can understand a bit of their language, especially one that she describes 
as the “leader,” and they tak e her on board by force, flying her around the world and “near the stars.” The craft is 
warm inside and it has comfortable seats. The beings want her to stay with them, but she r efuses, and they return 
her to the road outside her house.  (Heikki Virtanen, “ First Known Abduction Case in Finland? ” Nordic UFO 
Newsletter,  1988 no. 1, pp. 3 –4) 
 
1917, April — Night. Residents of the African  American neighborhood of Charlotte , North Carolina, report hearing 
strange, motor -like noises in the air at night for several nights. Some have fleeting glimpses of the swiftly  moving 
dark objects that are causing the noise. ( “The Colored People Are Seeing Visions, ” Charlotte (N.C.) News,  April

1917, April 13 — Early morning ? Two National Guardsmen are stationed on the railroad bridge linking Portsmouth, New 
Hampshire, and Kittery, Maine , when they hear the noise of an airplane. They see an unidentified aircraft circling near the bridge. When it descends , apparently to make a pass at the bridge, one of the guardsmen panics and fires 
his rifle at it. It moves off and disappears in the distance. A police officer on duty at Rochester, New Hampshire, 
hears an aerial noise that he assumes is an airplane, and James Walker, a railway motorman, sees an airplane over 
Gonic, New Hampshire, high in the air and flying north. (“Hunt for Aircraft Base,” Manchester (N.H.) Union,

1917, May 13 — Three shepherd children at the Cova da Iria in Fátima, Portugal —Lúcia dos Santos  and her 
cousins  Francisco and Jacinta Marto —report seeing a woman “brighter than the sun, shedding rays of light clearer 
and stronger than a crystal goblet filled with the most sparkling water and pierced by the burning rays of the sun.” 
The woman wears a white mantle edged with gold and holds a ro sary in her hand. She asks them to devote 
themselves to the Holy Trinity and to pray “the Rosary every day.” The children had seen an “angel” at the cove 
since the spring of 1916. ( Wikipedia, “ Our Lady of Fátima ”) 
 
1917, June 13 — The three children at Fátima , Portugal,  again see the lady, who reveals that Francisco and Jacinta  will be 
“taken to heaven” soon, but Lúcia  will live longer to spread the message.  The lady also purportedly reveals to the 
children a vision of hell and entrusts a secret to them, described as “good for some and bad for others.” 
(Wikipedia, “ Our Lady of Fátima ”) 
 
1917, August 13 — Some 18,000 people have been flocking to Fátima and nearby Aljustrel, Portugal, drawn by reports of 
visions and miracles. The assembled multitude hears thunder and witnesses lightning in a clear blue sky. Then the 
sun grows pale and a cloud hovers above the oak tree where the apparitions usually appear. Provincial 
administrator  Artur de Oliveira Santos , believing that these events are politically disruptive, t akes the children 
into custody, jailing them before they can reach the Cova da Iria. Santos interrogates and threatens the children to 
get them to divulge the contents of the secrets.  
1917, August 19 — Instead of the promised apparition in the Cova da Iria on August 13, the children see the Virgin Mary 
at nearby  Valinhos , Portugal . She asks them again to pray the rosary daily, speaks about the miracle coming in 
October, and asks them “to pray a lot.”  
1917, Late Summer — 12:30 p.m. John Boback is walking along railroad tracks in Youngstown, Pennsylvania, when he 
hears a swishing sound and sees an elliptical object  about 100 feet away on the ground in a pasture. It has 
portholes emitting lig ht from the interior and a smooth surface. Moments later the object ascends smoothly in a 
gradual climb and flies away to the east. (Lore and Deneault, pp. 104 –105) 
 
1917, Early September — Witnesses at Salida, Colorado, watch distant moving lights flicking on and off over a period of 
several days. Through a telescope, one light appears to be a revolving wheel with lights on it. ( Arlene Shovald, 
“Edwards ’ UFO Sighting Not Salida ’s First,” Salida (Colo.) Mountain Mail,  September 7, 1995; Clark III 1171)  
1917, September 13 — With the three children in attendance, the crowd at the Cova da Iria , Portugal,  see a “luminous 
globe” sail across the sky. A white cloud envelops the children and the oak tree. A rain of white roses is said to 
have fallen out of the heavens but dissolves just before landing. Behind the cloud, the crowd can see Lúcia  talking 
to the invisible lady.  
 
1917, October — Seven -year-old Elizabeth Klarer  and her older sister Barbara have their first alleged encounter with a 
UFO on their parents ’ farm Connington in the KwaZulu -Natal midlands, South Africa. While playing outside the 
farmhouse, Elizabeth claims t o witness a giant orange -red wheel rolling across the sky. The plummeting object, 
also described as a fiery pockmarked meteor or planetoid, is intercepted by a silver disc bathed in a pearly luster. 
Around this time Elizabeth begins receiving occasional tel epathic messages from a friendly space alien named 
Akon. (Clark III 657; Elizabeth Klarer, Beyond the Light Barrier,  Howard Timmins, 1980)  
1917, October 13 — After some newspapers report that the Virgin Mary has promised a miracle for the last of her 
apparitions, a huge crowd, possibly between 30,000 and 100,000, including reporters and photographers, gathers at Cova da Iria , Portugal . What happens then becomes known as the “Miracle of the Sun.” Various claims are 
made as to  what really happen ed. The three children report  seeing a panorama of visions during the event, 
including those of  Jesus , Our Lady of Sorrows , Our Lady of Mount Carmel , and Saint Joseph  blessing the peopl e. 
Father John  de Marchi, an Italian Catholic priest and researcher who wrote several books on the subject, included 
descriptions by witnesses who believe they observed a miracle created by  Mary, the mother of Jesus. After a 
period of rain, the dark clouds br eak and the Sun appear s as an opaque, spinning disc in the sky. It appears  
significantly duller than normal and cast s multicolored lights across the landscape, the people, and the 
surrounding clouds. The Sun then seems to careen  towards the earth before zigzagging back to its normal 
positi on. Witnesses report  that their previously wet clothes bec ome “suddenly and completely dry, as well as the 
wet and muddy ground that had been previously soak ed because of the rain that had been falling. ” Not all 
witnesses report  seeing the Sun “dance .” Some people only s ee the radiant colors, and others, including some 
believers, s ee nothing at al l. Th e only known picture of the Sun taken during the event does not show anything 
unusua l. No unusual solar phenomen a are observed by scientists . Some  theologians, scientists, and skeptics have 
offered alternative explanations that include psychological suggestibility of the witnesses, temporary retinal  
distortion  caused by staring at the intense light of the Sun, a sundog, and optical effects caused by natural 
meteorological phenomena.  The Miracle of the Sun is interpreted by others as a UFO event.  Investigator Joe 
Nickell  thinks that the effects are “a combination of factors, including optical effects and meteorological 
phenomena, such as the sun being seen through thin clouds, causing it to appear as a silver disc. Other 
possibilities include an alteration in the density of the passing clouds, causing the sun ’s image to alternately 
brighten and dim and so seem to advance and recede, and dust or moisture droplets in the atmosphere refracting 
the sunlight and thus imparting a variety of colors.”  (Wikipedia, “ Miracle of the Sun ”; Santuária de Fátima,

1919  
 
1919  — Wireless inventor Guglielmo Marconi  claims that he has detected large -wavelength radio signals from Mars. He 
claims the most frequent signal is the Morse code for “S,” or three short dots. The signals, however, are 
subsequently traced to an experiment conducted by chemist Irving Langmuir  at the General Electric Laboratories 
in Schenectady, New York. ( “‘Hello, Earth! Hello! ’” White Earth (Minn.) The Tomahawk,  March 18, 1920 , p. 6 ) 
 
1919, January 22 — After 10:00 p.m. A brilliant light the size of a tennis ball appears in a garden at Shuttlewood, 
Derbyshire, England . When the witness approaches it, it moves away at a leisurely pace and passes through wire 
netting. It follows the top of a hedge, turns right, and ascends until it finds a break in the high branches of a tree, 
where it hovers for 3 minutes before flying on. The witness then notices his neighbor ’s farm is illuminated with 
bright white light. Several minutes later, the sphere retu rns to the garden, hovers another 3 minutes, then 
approaches the witness. As it does so, it turns from white to orange. It moves away, stops above a neighbor ’s 
garden, tr avels along a  hedge, traverses a field, and circles a row of houses before soaring into the sky and 
disappearing. The light is seen for 40 minutes. ( Mark Ian Birdsall, “The Luminous Pearl of 1919,” Quest

and creak. By the time it stops, the cloud has expanded more and now has a ragged appearance, bending toward 
the earth.  A black object shoots out of the bottom of the cloud, leaving a vapor trail, and begins making 6 –7 barrel  
rolls. It then peels off in a straight line, headed north. (Clark III 1 170; “Supersonic Jet in 1919? ” IUR/Frontiers of

They notice a similarly colored figure standing  in a door that has been lowered down. It makes strange guttural 
sounds. They see another figure running toward the stream leading to a pond.  This smaller one dips up some 
water into a can. The larger figure seems to be hurrying the smaller figure back int o the object. The door slams 
shut with a metallic sound , and the vehicle rises up quickly  with its three legs still out and goes over a hill. The 
soil where the object had been is covered with round spots that resemble cane marks.  (Clark III 263; Patrick

1919, December 1 — Boni & Liveright publishes Charles Fort ’s first book of scientific anomalies, The Book of the 
Damned.  Fort gathers reports of ob jects or “vessels” that he humorously  speculates might be visitors from a 
multitude of worlds that have come to earth over the centuries. Among his wilder expressions is the suggestion 
that floating land masses in the sky harbor civilizations and oceans. Fort also speculates that someone is f ishing 
for us and that an alien race considers us its property, warning off all interlopers . It receives positive reviews from 
Ben Hecht  and Booth Tarkington . (Charles Fort, The Book of the Damned,  Boni & Liveright, 1919; Wikipedia,

1923, October — Boni & Liveright publishes New Lands  by Charles Fort , who writes about odd aerial and astronomical 
observations: “It seems no more incredible  that up in the seemingly unoccupied sky there should be hosts of 
living things than that the seeming blank of the ocean, should swarm with life.” (Charles Fort, New Lands,  Boni & 
Liveright, 1923; Wikipedia, “ New Lands ”; Jim Steinmeyer, Charles Fort : The Man Who Invented the

1924  
 
1924, January — 1:00 a.m. Perry G. Powers and Duncan Miller are returning to a ranch when they see a  beam of light 
shining on the snow in the Osage Hills, Oklahoma. It emanates from a large  oval-shaped object with white dots of light on the side and blue flame at the trailing end. It makes a slight hissing noise and moves out of sight over the 
horizon  in less than 3 minutes . (UFOEv , p. 129; “1924 Sighting, ” Civilian Saucer Investigation Quarterly Bulletin  
1, no. 4 (Winter 1954): 10 ) 
 
1924, August 22 — Mars enters an opposition closer to Earth than at any time in the century before. In the U S, a National 
Radio Silence Day is promoted during a 36 -hour period in August 21 –23, with all radios quiet for 5 minutes on 
the hour, every hour, just in case the Martians take the opportunity to communicate with Earth. At the U S Naval 
Observatory  in Washington, D.C. , an SE -950 radio receiver is lifted 1.9 miles above the ground in a dirigible 
tuned to a wavelength between 8 and 9  kilometers , using a  “radio photo message continuous transmission 
machine” recently invented by  Amherst College and  Charles  Francis Jenkins  of Washington. The program is led 
by retired astronomer David Peck Todd  with the military assistance of Chief of Naval Operations Adm . Edward 
Walter Eberle , with William F. Friedman  (US Army chief cryptographer), assigned to translate any potential 
Martian messages. The device record s radio signals on chemically treated film. One signal consist s of a “fairly 
regular arrangement of dots and dashes along one side” and on the other “at almost evenly spaced intervals … 
curiously jumped groups each taking the forms of a crudely  drawn human face.” Todd  tells a reporter, “It may not 
be a message from Mars, but if it isn ’t from Mars, whe re is it from?”  Astronomer Frederick E. Fowle  of the 
Smithsonian thinks they are “ disturbances  introduced by solar or terrestrial causes not yet understood.”  Other 
scientists suggest the images are caused by static discharge from a passing trolley car, malfunctioning radio 
equipment, or the natural symphonic radio waves produced by Jupiter.  (Jerome Clark, “ Conversations with 
Martians, ” IUR 29, no. 3  (Fall 2004 ): 20; Michael D. Swords, “ Radio Signals from Space, Alien Probes, and

1926, October 27 — Attorney and “telepathist” H ugh Mansfield Robinson, who has been in contact with a female Martian 
entity named Oomaruru since 1918, convinces the central radio office in London, England, to send out a message, 
“MMM opesti  nipitia secomba ” over the airwaves. He intends for it to be picked up by Martian wireless. The next 
day, he claims that Oomaruru telepathically told him that only the first three letters had been received. Robinson 
describes the Martians as 7 –8 feet tall with large ears,  a wealth of black hair, and almond eyes.  Over the years he 
continues receiving messages from Oomaruru while in a trance and attempting to send signals to Mars. Psychic 
investigator  Nandor Fodor , who has attended some of Robinson ’s séances, calls him “as slippery as a human eel.”

Pettit  and Seth B arnes  Nicholson , astronomers at the Mount Wilson Observatory in Pasadena, California, 
describing her encounters with telepathic aliens who fly in a circular machine “like a great big lamp.” She writes 
that “The Planet mars is inhabited by human spirits like us can talk eat & drink wear clothes, but have great 
power. They are something  people of this earth have never seen.” Their ships “are round like the moon with 
airtight shutter at the front, glass. The machine must be built with some light material, airproof fireproof, 
waterproof. The inside must be like a room, 2 be ds tables & chairs.” Much of her information seems to be derived

1933, Summer — For weeks, strange lights in the sky are reported around  Tobin Lake, Saskatchewan. Curious about the 
reports, two young men and a woman drive to t he lake from Napawin. On their way they see a glow near the 
horizon, so they park a nd trek a quarter mile into the woods where they can see a large, oval -shaped craft sitting 
on legs. From an open central doorway shines a bright orange glow; a ladderlike stairway extends downward with 
a dozen figures dressed in silver suits moving up and down the steps.  They appear to be repairing the craft. The 
witnesses watch for 30 minutes when they decide to return to their truck and get closer. Two nights later they 
return and find imprints and burn marks, which they photograph. Two of them write an article that the y submit to 
magazines, which refuse to publish what they consider outlandish fiction. ( John Brent Musgrave, “ Saskatchewan,

1933, Summer — 2:30 a.m. A man who still insists on anonymity in 1964 is driving near Cherryville, Pennsylvania, when 
his car gets a flat tire. As he is jacking it up, he sees a faint violet light in the field on his right. Curious, he walks 
about 200 feet towar d the light and sees a bell -shaped object about 10 feet in diameter and 6 feet high on the 
grass. Light is issuing from a circular door about 1 foot in diameter. He pushes it and it swings open. Putting his 
head inside, he cannot see much because of the peculiar light coming from the ceiling. The chamber inside is 
about 6 feet in diameter, 4 feet high, and full of tubing and dials on a console. An ammonia scent pervades the 
room, which is notably chilly. The man then walks around the object, touching the surface, which is slick, 
metallic, and cold. After 10 minutes, he goes back to the car, replaces the ti re, and drives home. ( “Flying Saucer

reflector when he sees a series of intermittent bright flashes across the south polar cap. A line of tiny white spots 
seems to extend across the cap, some coalescing to swell in a brilliant white spot that quickly becomes yellow, 
then red -yellow, the “phenomenon passing from left to right across the polar cap.” (Latimer J. Wilson, “ Apparent 
Flashes Seen on Mars, ” Popular Astronomy  45 (1937): 430; Walter H. Haas, “ Flashes on Mars Observed in 1937

1937, Summer — An object allegedly falls from the sky in Langenau [now Czernica, Poland] into a field belonging to 
Eva Braun ’s family and is retrieved by German soldiers. It supposedly winds up in Wern her von Braun ’s 
laboratory , but the story is probably mythical. (Poland 116 –117)

New York City . (Fortean Society Magazine  1, no. 1  (September 1937 ); Clark III 516 ) 
1937, September — Electrical engineer Grote Reber  builds one of the first radio telescopes in his back yard in Wheaton, 
Illinois. It consists of a parabolic dish of sheet metal 30 feet in diameter tuned to a radio receiver 25 feet above the 
dish.  Although he does not confirm Jansky’s 1933 discovery of radio wav es in space, he does so with his third 
model in 1938. (Wikipedia, “ Grote Reber ”; Grote Reber, “Cosmic Static,” Astrophysical Journal  91 (June 1940):

 1938 
 
1938  — The Ford Foundation  and Rockefeller Foundation  begin contributing large amounts of money to the Council on 
Foreign Relations. They create various Committees on Foreign Relations throughout the country, which later 
become governed by the American Committees on Foreign Relations in  Washington, D.C. , funded by a grant 
from the  Carnegie Corporation . Influential men are chosen in several cities and are brought together for 
discussions in their own communities as well as participating in an annual conference in New York. These local 
committees serv e to influence local leaders and shape public opinion to build support for the council ’s policies, 
while also acting as “useful listening posts” through which the Council and US government can “sense the mood 
of the country.” ( Wikipedia, “ Council on Foreign Relations ”) 
1938  — Harvey L. Sperry, 13, sees a white, vapor -like object moving at 5 –10 mph at less than 100 feet altitude from 
north to south in Minneapolis , Minnesota . Its rim seems to be “composed of two interwoven parts revolving and 
moving in opposite directions.” (Lore and Deneault , p. 136; Clark III 1176)  
 
1938, February — Raymond A.  Palmer  is hired as editor of Amazing  Stories  magazine, owned by Ziff -Davis in Chicago , 
Illinois . He immediately sets out to enliven the  periodical , which  is close to folding. Concentrating on “space 
opera” stories, he expands its size t o more than 200 pages and encourages readers to contribute content.

1938, July 25 — 11:30 p.m. A lieutenant and his aide see a strong lig ht coming from a hovering lens -shaped object near 
Guadalajara, Spain. It is over 35 feet in diameter and 15 feet high. A platform with two moving figures is lowered 
from underneath. A blue beam from the object shines on the witnesses, who feel a sudden chil l. The platform rises 
back up, and the object glows with an intense white light and flies away. ( Vicente -Juan Ballester Olmos, “ Survey

1938, October — Dusk. A man is in a cornfield with his father near Alger, Ohio, when an object moves up and hovers 
about 500 feet above the field. The tractor motor stops running. The object is about 100 feet in diameter and has a 
ring of pulsating, multicolored lights around it. Soon it makes a right -angle turn and vanishes in the sky , after 
which they get the tractor working again. (Michael D. Swords, “ The Timmerman Files, ” IUR 26, no. 4 (Winter

1938, October 22 — Italian Lt. Col. Mario Pezzi  reaches a record altitude of 56,850 feet in a Caproni Ca.161. It is still the 
highest a manned , propeller -driven biplane has gone. (Wikipedia, “ Mario Pezzi (aviator) ”) 
1938, October 30 — 8:00 p.m. “The War of the Worlds ” episode of the American radio drama anthology series  The 
Mercury Theatre on the Air,  directed and narrated by actor and future filmmaker  Orson Welles , is an adaptation 
of H. G. Wells ’s novel  The War of the Worlds  (1898). It is performed and broadcast live in New York City as a 
Halloween episode  over the  Columbia Broadcasting System  radio network. Some listeners hear only a portion of 
the broadcast and, in the tension and anxiety prior to World War II, mist ake it for a genuine news broadcast.  
Thousands of them share the false reports with others or call the media or police to ask if the broadcast is real. 
Many newspapers assume that the large number of phone calls and the scattered reports of listeners rushing about 
or fleeing their homes prove the existence of a mass panic, but such behavior is not widespread  and the program 
has rela tively few listeners. According to media historian Joseph W. Campbell, the most common response said to 
indicate a panic is calling the local newspaper or police to confirm the story or seek additional information. That, 
he writes, is an indicator that people are not generally panicking or hysterical. “The call volume perhaps is best 
understood as an altogether  rational  response .” Some New Jersey media and law enforcement agencies receive up 
to 40% more telephone calls than normal during the broadcast . In the days after the adaptation, widespread 
outrage is expressed in the media. The program ’s news -bulletin format is described as deceptive by some 
newspapers and public figures, leading to an outcry against the broadcasters and calls for regulation by the FCC, 
which declines. Some government agencies in the US, Germany, and Russia take note of how segments of the 
population are easily manipulated into thinking fiction is fact.  According to Annie Jacobsen,  the confusion allegedly inspires Joseph Stalin  to create a similar scenario with a fake alien crash in the US. West Windsor, New 
Jersey, where Grovers Mill (the scene of the Martian invasion) is located, commemorated the 50th anniversary of 
the broadcast in 1988 with four days of festivities including art and planetarium shows, a panel discussion, a 
parade, burial of a time capsule, a dinner dance, film festivals devoted to H. G. Wells and Orso n Welles, and the 
dedication of a bronze monument to the fictional Martian landings.  (Wikipedia, “ The War of the Worlds  (1938

1939?  — Sisters Lucile  and Allene Holt , daughters of Rev. Turner Hamilton Holt , claim they are separately told by their 
father, a cousin of Secretary of State Cordell Hull , that Hull personally showed Holt a wrecked circular craft of 
some kind and glass jars holding unknown creatures. These are stored in a sub -basement of the US Capitol 
building in Washington, D.C. Both sisters are told the story when Holt is a minister at the Shenandoah Christian 
Church in Greenwich, Ohio, before 1947, but researchers can find no confirmation in any of Hull ’s papers or 
memoirs. ( William E. Jones and Eloise G. Watson, “ Pre–World War II ‘Creature ’ Retrieval? ” IUR 26, no. 4

1939, January  13 — The process of nuclear fission is explain ed theoretically in Stockholm , Sweden,  by Lise Meitner  and 
her nephew Otto Robert Frisch,  who compares it to the biological fission of living cells.  (Atomic Heritage 
Foundation, “ Atomic Timeline ”) 
1939, January 25 — A Columbia University team conducts t he first nuclear fission experiment in the US in the basement 
of Pupin Hall  on the south side of 120th Street in New York City . The experiment involves placing uranium oxide 
inside an  ionization chamber  and irradiating it with neutrons, then measuring the energy released. The results 
confirm that fission is occurring and hints strongly that it is the isotope  uranium -235 that is undergoing fission.  
(Richard Rhodes, The Making of the Atomic Bomb,  Simon &  Schuster, 1986, pp. 267 –270) 
1939, January 26 —The Carnegie Institution of Washin gton holds a press conference at the Fifth Washington Conference

1939, Late summer — A girl sleeping in the back yard of her home in Fort Worth, Texas, is awakened by a whirring 
noise. She sees a small object approaching from the east at an altitude of 20 –30 feet. When it gets close , it 
descends to the level of her bed and hovers briefly at the foot, so close that she c an touch it. It has the shape of an 
“old-time Mississippi steamboat with a deck around the bottom.”  Strata or veins run through it , and a soft, blue -
green glow surrounds it. It is 3 feet around and 1 foot high. It rises suddenly and disappears. ( “Woman Says 
Strange Object Flew by Her Bed in Yard, ” Fort Worth (Tex.) Star -Telegram,  March 24, 1950 , p. 23 ; Clark III

1939, Early August — George Pârvu and f our other schoolchildren are playing in an open field in Armășești , Romania, 
when they see a bright light in the sky moving in a zigzag fashion. It circles a few times then descends in their 
direction, getting bigger and brighter. The egg -shaped object  hovers silently at an altitude of 230 –260 feet. 
Suddenly it becomes a dull coppery color and lands about 140 feet away.  Two of the children flee but Pârvu  and 
two others remain. The bottom of the object has a ring of sma ll turbine blades that look like paddles in a water 
mill. It seems to be 16 feet high. A hatch opens and two little men about 4 feet tall come out, dressed in gray 
diving suits. They walk toward the children, one of them holding a rectangular box pointing at the ground. The 
children approach them, holding hands, but  when they are about 23 feet away the other man points a thick stick -
like device at them and they are no longer able to move forward. The little men bow in their direction, waist deep, 
then turn around and reenter the object, which takes off.  The children find a circular area of yellowed grass where 
the object had been. Pârvu  feels energized, but one of the other boys is temporarily sick. Pârvu  encounters what he perceives to be the same object in August 1944, August 1949, and the summer of 1954 (in the center of 
Bucharest).  (George Pârvu , La voia destinului,  CNI Coresi, 2011; Romania 124 –128) 
 
1939, August 2 — Hungarian -American physicist Leo Szil árd writes a confidential letter to President Roosevelt,  in 
consultation with fellow  Hungarian  physicists  Edward Teller  and Eugene Wigner.  He has persuaded Albert 
Einstein  to sign it as well. The letter warns that Germany might develop  atomic bombs  and suggests that the 
United States should start its own nuclear program. It results in the establishment of research into nuclear fission 
by the US government, and ultimately to the creation of the  Manhattan Project . Delayed by the outbreak of war in 
Europe, the letter is eventually hand -delivered to Roosevelt by economist Alexander Sachs  on October 11. 
Roosevelt gives the letter to his aide,  Brig. Gen.  Edwin “Pa” Watson  with the instruction: “Pa, this requires 
action!”  (Wikipedia, “ Einstein –Szilard letter ”; Atomic Heritage Foundation, “ Atomic Timeline ”) 
 
1939, October — An egg -shaped object with 8 spots like portholes is observed through an astronomical reflector 
telescope at Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin. ( Richard H. Hall,  From Airships to Arnold,  UFO Research Coalition,

1939, October 21 — After reading Szilárd’s letter, Roosevelt  creates an Advisory Committee on Uranium, which meets 
for the first time at the National Bureau of Standards in Washington, D.C. The committee consists of NBS 
Director Lyman J ames  Briggs,  Army Lt. Col. Keith F. Adamson,  and Navy Cmdr. Gilbert C. Hoover.  It is 
attended by physicists Fred L. Mohler  from the National Bureau of Standards and Richard B rooke  Roberts  from 
the Carnegie Institution of Washington , and Szilárd, Wigner , and Teller . Einstein  is invited but decline s to attend. 
Adamson is skeptical about the prospect of building an atomic bomb, but is willing to authorize $6,000 
(equivalent to $107,000 in 2018 dollars) for the purchase of uranium and  graphite  for Szilárd and Enrico Fermi ’s 
experiments into producing a nuclear chain  reaction at Columbia University.  (Wikipedia, “ S-1 Executive 
Committee ”) 
 
1939, November 13 — 7:00 a.m . A building foreman is driving past a deserted farm near Brockworth, Gloucester, 
England , when he hears a high -pitched humming sound. He watches a gray, bell -shaped object hovering about 20 
feet above  a field  100 feet away . He estimates it is about 25 feet across. Dark window -like patches are visible on 
the side. A “curtain” of blue-green  light emanates from the underside. After about two minutes, the green light 
retracts into the base of the object. The object then tilts to an angle of about 80 ° and moves away without a sound.

1940, March — George Adamski  moves from Laguna Bea ch to  a property along the Star Route in  Valley Center, 
California, about 9 miles from where Palomar Observatory is under construction to set up a spiritual retreat.  He 
acquires a 15 -inch telescope to create an interest in astronomy.  (“Palomar Mountain, 1940 –1960: From Obscurity 
to World Fame, ” The Adamski Case , September 22, 2019 ) 
1940, March — US physicist John R. Dunning  and colleagues at Columbia University verify the hypothesis of Danish 
physicist Niels Bohr  that fission is more readily produced in the rare u ranium -235 isotope than the abundant  
uranium -238 isotope. Dunning begins investigating gaseous diffusion as a process for enriching uranium. (Atomic 
Heritage Foundation, “ Atomic Timeline ”) 
1940, March — Otto Robert Frisch  and Rudolf Peierls,  two researchers at the  University of Birmingham  in England —
who ironically have been assigned to investigate nuclear weapons by  Australian physicist Mark Oliphant  because, 
as enemy aliens in Britain, they are ineligible to participate in secret war work —issue the  Frisch -Peierls 
memorandum . It contradicts the common thinking of the time that many tons of uranium would be needed to 
make a bomb, requiring delivery by ship. The calculation in the memorandum shows that a bomb might be possible using as little as 1 –10 kilograms of pure uranium -235, which would be quite practical for aircraft to 
carry. (Wikipedia, “ Frisch –Peierls memorandum ”; Atomic Heritage Foundation, “ Atomic Timeline ”) 
1940, March 22 — Franklin D. Roosevelt  signs Executive Order 8381, creating the three security levels for the most

in the northern sky. They are traveling together at 100 –200 mph and disappear into a cloud. (Clark III 1177)  
1940, April 10 — The first meeting of the MAUD Committee in England, established in response to the Frisch -Peierls 
memo randum  to determine if an atomic bomb is feasible, meets in the Royal Society committee room in 
Burlington House, London. The original members are physicists George Paget Thomson,  James Chadwick,  John 
Cockcroft,  Mark Oliphant , and Philip Burton Moon ; physicists Patrick Blackett,  Charles Drummond 
Ellis, and chemist Norman Haworth  are subsequently added, along with a representative of the Director of 
Scientific Research at the  Ministry of Aircraft Production  (MAP).  (Wikipedia, “ MAUD Committee ”) 
 
1940, May — Morning. Dutch immigrant Udo Wartena  is working his mining claim near the base of Boulder Mountain, 
Montana, when he hears a humming sound. Curious, he climbs to higher ground and sees a large silver disc, 100 
feet across, hovering a short distance away. A circular stairway is let down, a ma n descends it, and starts walking 
toward Wartena , who approaches him. The man has white hair and is wearing gray overalls, a gray cap, and 
slippers. He asks in English if his crew can take on some water, Wartena agrees, and a hose is let down into a 
stream. Wartena is invited onto the craft, where he me ets another white -haired man who says they are about 600  
and 900 years old. The first man explains that the craft moves by using stored stellar energy. Wartena chats with 
them further and is subjected to an examination by an X -ray-like machine.  As he is let off, the man tells him not 
to tell anyone about the incident. Wartena keeps that promise until right before his death in 1989. (Warren P.

1940,  June — Afternoon. An anti -aircraft unit on the Isle of Hoy, Orkney Islands, Scotland, receives an alert that proves 
to be a false alarm. The witness, using a height -and-range finder, focuses on an unusual object in the sky. For 10 
seconds he tracks an oblate spheroid moving rapidly in a horizontal path, its height recorded at 38,000 feet. ( Jenny 
Randles and Peter Warrington, Science and the UFOs,  Basil Blackwell, 1985, p. 9) 
 
1940, August 11 — The RAF Bomber Command issues a report on “Phenomena Connected with Enemy Night Tactics” 
concerning unidentifiable aircraft observed by bombing crews over the coast of Holland and the Ruhr Valley of 
Germany. The report suggests the sightings ar e either due to observer strain or German “experimental apparatus.”

 1940, September 19 — English inventor Henry Tizard  leads a secret delegation to Washington, D.C., to meet with 
Vannevar Bush  and Alfred Lee Loomis  of the US National Defense Research Committee to disclose the technical 
details of the UK’s Chain Home early warning radar stations, which have been locating incoming Luftwaffe 
bombers. The US shares its Navy’s longwave CXAM radar system but admit that it  does not have enough 
transmitter power. At a subsequent meeting on October 6, Edward George Bowen  and John Cockcroft  reveal the 
cavity magnetron, a direction -finding device with an amazing power output of about 10 kilowatts at 10 
centimet ers. The exchange opens up channels of communication for jet engine and atomic bomb development and 
catalyzes Allied technological cooperation during World War II. ( Wikipedia, “ Tizard Mission ”; Robert Buderi,

1941  — A physicist and his wife are traveling no rth on US Highway 99 north of Bakersfield, California, and pull off to 
the side to watch a long, slender object of a blazing red, green, and yellow color moving about 8 miles east of 
them. It is traveling at about 50 mph at an altitude of 200 –300 feet and is  clearly outlined against the foothills. It 
seems to be several times longer than a bomber. (“ Recent Sightings, ” APRO Bulletin,  January 1957, p. 5) 
 
1941, Early spring — 9:00–9:30 p.m . Rev. William Guy Huffman  of the Red Star Baptist Church in Cape Girardeau, 
Missouri, is summoned to an apparent airplane crash one Saturday. When he arrives at the scene, about 15 miles 
from town , he finds a weird -looking craft “broken and scattered all around,” but smooth an d rounded without 
edges or seams. A cockpit with a chair facing an instrument panel remains intact. Police officers, military men, 
and plain -clothes individuals are sifting through the wreckage. He also sees three non -human bodies about 4 feet 
tall with lon g arms, oversized heads, and large eyes. He says a prayer for th em, and afterward sees someone take a 
photo of an alien propped up by the arms between two plainclothesmen.  The following evening , he is given a 
copy of the photo  by a member of his congregation (thought to be Garland D. Fronabarger ), but he loans it later to 
someone who never returns it.  Huffman ’s wife Floy reveals the story to her granddaughter, Charlette Mann, on 
her deathbed in 1984, who relates the story to ufologist Leonard Stringfield . (Clark III 343 –344; Paul Blake

1941, June 26 — The first draft of the final report of the MAUD Committee is written by George Paget Thomson  and 
circulates among committee members. It concludes that an atomic bomb is feasible. Vannevar Bush  receives a 
copy.  Without the help of the MAUD Committee the  Manhattan Project  would have started months behind. Instead , they are able to begin thinking about how to create a bomb, not whether it is possible.  (Wikipedia, 
“MAUD Committee ”) 
1941, June 28 — Roosevelt  establishes the Office of Scientific Research and Development; Vannevar Bush  is appointed 
director.  It subsumes the National Defense Research Committee, whose Uranium Committee becomes the 
Uranium Section of the OSRD, soon renamed the S -1 for security reasons. To the S -1 Section, Vannevar Bush 
adds American physicist Samuel King Allison , Russian -American physicist Gregory Breit , American physicist 
Edward Condon , physicist Lloyd P. Smith , and Henry D eWolf  Smyth . American physicist Ross Gunn  is dropped

1941, October 9 — Roosevelt  approves an atomic weapons program after meeting with Office of Scientific Research and 
Development  Director Vannevar Bush  and Vice President Henry A. Wallace.  On Bush ’s advice, Roosevelt 
chooses the US A rmy to run the project rather than the Navy, although the  Navy has shown far more interest in 
the field, and is already conducting research into atomic energy for powering ships. Bush ’s negative experiences 
with the Navy has convinced him that it would not listen to his advice  and cannot handle large -scale construction 
projects.  (Cameron Reed, “ Manhattan Project Mystery, ” Forum on the History of Physics, Spring 2012)

Compton  is allocated $340,000 for  nuclear reactor  research at Columbia and Princeton, and $278,000 at 
the University of Chicago . Another $500,000 is earmarked for raw materials. His proposed schedule is no less 
breathtaking: to produce a nuclear chain reaction by July 1942, and an atomic bomb by January 1945. In January 
1942, he creates the  Metallurgical Laboratory , centralizing the work at the University of Chicago.  (Wikipedia, “ S-

1942, February 24 –25 — The Battle of Los Angeles  takes place,  a rumored enemy attack and subsequent ant i-aircraft 
barrage over Los Angeles , California . Air raid sirens sound throughout Los Angeles County on the night of 
February 24. A total blackout is ordered , and thousands of air raid wardens are summoned to their positions. At 
3:16 a.m., the 37th Coast Artillery Brigade begins firing .50 caliber machine guns and 12.8 -pound anti -aircraft 
shells into the air at reported aircraft; more than  1,400 shells are eventually fired. Pilots o f the 4th Interceptor 
Command a re alerted , but their aircraft remain  grounded. The artillery fire continue s sporadically until 4:14  a.m. 
The “all clear ” is sounded and the blackout order lifted at 7:21  a.m. Several buildings and vehic les are damaged 
by shell fragm ents, and five civilians die  as an indirect result of the anti -aircraft fire . Three are killed in car 
accidents in the ensuing chaos and two die of heart attacks attributed to the stress of the hour -long actio n. The 
incident i s front -page news along the Pacific coast and earn s some mass media coverage. Within hours of the end 
of the air raid, Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox  holds a press conference, saying the entire incident was a false 
alarm due to anxiety and “war nerves. ” Knox ’s comments are followed by statements from the Army on February 
26 that reflect  General George C. Marshall ’s belief that the incident was caused by commercial airplanes used as a 
psychological warfare campaign to generate panic. Some cont emporary press outlets suspect  a cover -up. Rep . 
Leland M. Ford  (R-Calif.) calls for a congressional investigation, saying, “none of the explanations so far offered 
removed the episode from the category of ‘complete mystification ’ ... this was either a practice raid, or a raid to 
throw a scare into 2,000,000 people, or a mistaken identity raid, or a raid to lay a political foundation to take away 
Southern California ’s war industries. ” The Japanese government, after the war ended, declare s that they had flown 
no airplanes ov er Los Angeles during the war. In 1983, the US Office of Air Force History attribute s the event to 
a case of “war nerves ” triggered by a lost weather balloon and exacerbated by stray flares  and shell bursts from 
adjoining batteries. A number of fake documents about this incident have been circulated by Timothy S. Cooper .

aircraft is approaching the rear of heir aircraft. S obiński sees a bright light that he thinks might be a searchlight on 
a German fighter . As it draws closer, he sees it has a coppery color. When it reaches to 600 feet away, the rear 
gunner fires on it. S obiński not ices that the tracer rounds are hitting the object but have no effect, merely 
disappearing on impact. After 2 minutes, the object moves to the port side at terrific speed and stays 600 feet off 
the left wing. Both the rear and front gunner, Sgt. Krzysztof Grabowski , fire rounds at it to no effect. S obiński

Poland. They notice a flying object approaching them  at about 60 mph.  Through binoculars it appears to be a 
sphere colored with tangled strips of both raspberry and blue -green colors.  Bzowski estimates it is at an elevation 
of 200 feet and is about 25 feet in diameter. They observe German and Lithuanian snipers on Bonifraterska street 
shooting at it, although the bullets seem to pass throu gh it. The object alters course and heads toward Old Town,

his entire crew see a “huge orange ball on or near the sea” 7,000 –8,000 feet below them. Over the next 10 
minutes, they watch it project a bright and constant light. ( Strange Company  41) 1943,  May — Late night. John Walker is serving as an RAF armaments officer at a small airfield near Ludham, Norfolk, 
England . Walking home from a village dance, he notices a green glow in the road ahead. Getting closer, he sees 
that it is coming from a man standing by the side of the road. He is wearing a diving helmet on his head and an 
oblong object on his chest. The green gl ow is coming from his chest and fanning upward over his face, which has 
a “sickly grin.” He does not react to Walker’s presence in a ny way. In an adjacent field, Walker can see a large 
domed object like a “bell tent.” Standing next to it are two more figures, both wearing a grayish garment. Walker 
moves quickly past and returns to his airfield. (Philip Mantle, “ Pre-1947 Entity and UFO in Norfolk? An I.U.N.

fighter to the A ir Tactical Service Command . Two days later, the go -ahead is given to Lockheed to start 
development, and the Skunk Works is born in Burbank, California, with Johnson at the helm.  The name 
supposedly comes from the L’il Abner  comic strip, which has a place called “Skonk Works” where a strong 
beverage is brewed from skunks, old shoes, and other ingredients.  (Wikipedia, “ Skunk Works ”) 
1943, July 18 — A French prisoner in a German labor camp near Gdynia, Poland , is walking to work along the Baltic Sea 
when he sees a flat, metallic object embedded in the sand. A human figure is standing next to it, apparently trying 
to dig it up. When he passes by, the figure, apparently an Asian woman with long blonde hair and d ressed in a 
tight-fitting overall, turns in his direction. The witness assumes she is the famous German aviator Hanna Reitsch  
and helps her dig the experimental aircraft out of the sand. The object is 20 feet in diameter and looks like two 
metallic saucers put together. The woman touches the witness ’s chest with her hand and points to the sky . She 
touches her belt and a door in the object opens. She crawls inside, the door closes, and the object ascends and 
departs at a tremendous speed. (Jean Sider, Ultra Top -Secret: Ces OVNIs qui font peur,  Axis Mundi, 1990)   
 
1943,  September — Morning. A witness driving a car in Laguna Larga, Córdoba, Argentina, sees a large, saucer -shaped 
object standing on the ground. It is wider than the road. When he approaches, the object begins to whistle like a 
motor , climbs to about 1,000 feet , and disappears at terrific speed. On the ground, the witness finds a bright object 
about 4 inches long. (Richard H. Hall, From Airships to Arnold,  UFO Research Coalition,  2000, p. 21)

1943, September — Ray Palmer,  editor of Amazing Stories  magazine, receives a letter from a reader named Richard S. 
Shaver,  who claims to have discovered “Mantong,” a proto -language  that is the source of all earthly languages. In 
Mantong, each sound has a hidden meaning, and by applying this formula to any word in any language, one can 
decode the secret meaning. Palmer applies the formula to several words and realizes Shaver might be onto 
something.  (Wikipedia, “ Richard Sharpe Shaver ”; Clark III 609 ; Walter Kafton -Minkel, Subterranean Worlds,  
Loompanics, 1989, p. 136 )

bomber does not return from the mission. ( Strange Company  43) 
 1943, Autumn — A Polish bomber unit based in England claims that silver -blue balls of fire appeared near their wing on 
six missions when they raided the Nazi V -1 weapons plant in Peenemünde, Germany. RAF intelligence officer 
Michael Bentine  debriefs them later and asks, “But what did it do to you?” They reply, “Nothing.” Bentine points 
out, “Well it was not a very effective weapon, was it?” (UFOFiles2, p. 20 ; David Clarke and Andy Roberts, “ The 
Foo Fighters: The RAF Experience, ” The Real UFO Project,  January 2003 ) 
1943,  October — Maj. Robert Visarius, Luftwaffe officer, is operating a ground defense radar during an Allied air 
offensive  in Kassel, Germany . After the raid, he notices a radar target about 24 miles away that at first is 
motionless. Then it moves rapidly toward his position and is tracked at a distance of 11 miles away. Through a 
powerful telescope mounted  on the radar, Visarius and his colle agues can see a silvery, light -reflecting object.

1943, October — 9:00 p.m. Wilberta Finley , an air spotter for t he Civil Air Patrol , notices a “huge dark  aerial object 
approaching” her home in Santa Barbara, California, facing the Goleta Valley. Moving low and soundlessly , it 
barely skims over a nearby hill. From its front a beam of light shoots down, and at intervals  it swings from side to 
side as if scanning the hills and homes below. (“Report fro m the Readers,” Fate 11, no. 11  (November 1958 ):

1943, October 14 — Night. A group of B -17s from the 384th Bombardment Group are returning from a mission  over 
Germany when they see a cluster of silver -colored discs in the path of their formation and closing with the 
bombers. The crews talk back and forth, discussing and confirming the sight before them.  They describe the 
objects as “about one inch thick and three inches in diameter…gliding down slowly in a very uniform cluster.” 
One of the bombe rs goes directly through the cluster “with absolutely no effect on engines or p lane surface,” even 
though one is heard to strike the tail assembly. A mass of black debris about 3 -4 feet long is also observed. (Clark

1943, November  — Ray Palmer  publishes an article, “An Ancient Language?” on the language of Mantong in  the January 
1944 issue of  Amazing Stories  and enters into correspondence with Richard S. Shaver , who respon ds with a 
10,000 -word document titled “A Warning to Future Man.” Shaver writes of advanced prehistoric races who built 
underground cities before abandoning Earth for another planet because of damaging radiation from the  Sun. 
Those ancients also abandoned some of their own offspring here, a minority of whom remained noble and human 
“Teros,” while most degenerate over time into a population of mentally impaired sadists known as “Deros” —
short for “detrimental  robots .” Shaver ’s robots are not mechanical constructs, but robot -like due to their savage 
behavior. These Deros still live in the cave cities, according to Shaver, kidnapping surface -dwelling people by the 
thousands for meat or torture. Deros can be blamed for nearly al l misfortunes, from minor “accidental” injuries or 
illnesses to airplane crashes and catastrophic natural disasters. Though generally confined to their caves, the 
Deros sometimes travel in  spaceships  or rockets , and have dealings with equally evil  extraterrestrial s. Shaver 
claims to possess first -hand knowledge of the Deros and their caves, insisting he had been their prisoner for 
several years. The article stirs considerable reader interest, and the pages of Amazing Stories  are soon filled with 
stories and  articles about the “Shaver mystery.” ( Wikipedia, “ Richard Sharpe Shaver ”; [Richard] S. Shaver,

1943, December? — Matt P. Dillingham is on  evening duty adjacent to Mullinix Field [now Bonriki International Airport] 
on Tarawa Atoll in the Pacific Ocean. He begins receiving radar plots showing a north -south track to the west 
moving at 750 mph.  It disappears, but two other targets on the same trajectory appear, moving at the same speed. 
The same targets are repeated for several night s following. (“ Out of the Past, ” CUFOS Associate Newsletter  4, no.

1943,  December — 10:30 p.m. Four young women are having supper opposite the wharf in Oslo Fjord, Norway, when 
they see a light that appears to be on the wharf. Fearing sabotage, they hurry into their cars and drive toward the 
wharf along a mountain road. All th ree cars stall at once, so they abandon them along the road and head down a 
snow -covered hillside toward an object on the ground that appears to be a hazy orange light shaped like a church 
bell. It is emitting a hissing sound. Moments later, the objec t rises up and hovers some 9 –18 feet above the water . 
It then moves off at “fantastic speed,” turning a deep blue color, and disappears. They advance to where the object 
was resting and find a crater -like impression about 4.5 feet in diameter and 3 feet deep. Outside this circle, the 
snow has melted. (Neville Thornhill, “ U.F.O. Lands in Norway —in 1943: Witness Describes First Recorder E -M

1943, December 2 — Night . Some 105 German Junkers Ju 888 bombers attack the port of Bari, Italy, a key supply center 
for Allied forces. 28 Allied ships are sunk, including the US Liberty ship SS John Harvey , which is carrying 
mustard gas intended for retaliation i n case  German forces use chemical warfare. Liquid sulfur mustard from the 
bombs spill s into waters already contaminated by oil from the other damaged vessels. The many sailors who 
abandoned their ships into the water bec ome covered with the oily mixture. The wounded are pulled from the 
water and sent to medical facilities whose personnel are unaware of the mustard gas. Medical staff focus on 
personnel with blast or fire injuries. Within a day, the first symptoms of mustard poisoning appear in 628 patients 
and medical staff, including blindness and chemical burns. That puzzling development is further complicated by 
the arrival of hundreds of Italian civilians also seeking treatment, who ha ve been poisoned by a cloud of sulfur 
mustard vapor that blow s over the city when some of  John Harvey ’s cargo explode s. As the medical crisis 
worsen s, little information is available about what is causing the symptoms, because US military command want 
to keep the presence of chemical munitions secret from the Germans. By the end of the month, 83 of the 628 
hospitalized military victims ha ve died. The number of civilian casualties, thought to have been even greater, 
cannot be accurately gauged since most ha ve left the city to seek shelter with relatives.  (Wikipedia, “ Air raid on 
Bari”) 
1943, December 11 — US bombers conduct a daylight raid on Emden, Germany, and observe an unknown object about 
the size of a Thunderbolt aircraft over the target area. It passes below the bombers in a straight line and at terrific 
speed, leaving a vapor trail that p ersists. ( Strange  Company  51–52) 
1943, December 14 — Night . British 255 Night Fighter Squadron leader Patrick Hardy Vesey Wells  is flying his Bristol 
Beaufighter on a patrol mission around Naples, Italy, when he and his navigator notice a small bright light behind 
them. It stays on their tail, moving from side to side. After 1 –2 minutes it goes off in another direction. ( Strange

1943, Winter — Day.  While on a bombing mission over central Germany, Sgt. Louis Kiss , a tail gunner on the Phyllis 
Marie,  a B-17 of the 390th Bombardment Group, sees an odd -looking sphere approach the plane from behind and 
below. It seems to be the size of a basketball and shimmery gold. The object hovers just above one wing, then 
passes over the top to the other  wing where it hovers again. Soon it moves to the rear and gets caught in the B -
17’s backwash and disappears.  (“First Official Foo -Fighter Records Discovered, ” Just Cause,  no. 32 (June 1992):

Surikov are flying over southwest Ukraine at an altitude of 3 miles when a large, elliptical object approaches them. The bomber starts shaking, the oil pressure rises, and Surikov feels a strong electrostatic charge. Even after 
the object passes, the bomber ’s wings are covered with glowing discharges. (Good Need , pp. 21–22) 
1944  — George Adamski  and his followers move closer to Palomar Mountain , California,  along the Road to the Stars 
where his long -time associate Alice K. Wells sets up a roadside café, Palomar Gardens. According to coworker 
Charlotte Blodget, “Each member of the group shared in the manual labor that went into this effort, and since 
heavy restrictions were still in effect regarding materials [in the war ’s aftermath], anything available had to 
serve.”  Adamski builds a “small observatory” to house his 15 -inch telescope to study the skies.  (“Palomar

crews are seeing either rockets fired from aircraft, parachute rockets, or high -explosive projectiles at maximum 
altitudes of 18,000 feet. Repo rts of objects changing their course are either defects causing erratic flight or light 
flak tracers reaching their highest point and descending.  (Strange Company  57–58) 
1944, February 20 — 2:30 a.m. Two guards of the 3rd Marine Division on Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands see what 
they first assume are the headlight beams of a truck coming from a swamp about three -quarters of a mile from 
their position.  It moves laterally about 50 feet and they see it is a circular light about 50 –60 feet long and 20 feet 
high.  It then rises into the air about 25 feet and heads in the direction of the guards at about 45 mph. It makes a 
45° turn and passes about 100 feet above the trees of  a coconut grove. Several days later, a  200-foot cut in the 
reeds is discovered in the approximate spot where the light originated. ( Alvin G. McNish, “Letter, ” CUFOS

1944, February 23 — Brig. Gen. George C. McDonald  is appointed ass istan t chief of staff for intelligence for the newly 
created US Strategic Air Forces in Europe. “Many months preceding the collapse of Germany, McDonald 
recognized the imperative need for the creation of a new type of intelligence activity to investigate and ex ploit air 
intelligence objectives in Germany and liberated countries. This unique system was established and consisted of a 
great number of highly qualified technical and scientific personnel to exploit all the worldwide aeronautical 
research developments of Germany. This resulted in the collection of priority intelligence information of value in 
the prosecution of the war against Japan; technical and non -technical information of immediate operational 
significance and value; as well as a substantial portion  of important documents and personnel of the German Air 
Ministry that enabled the US Army Air Forces to undertake long -range research with respect to many valuable -
phases of air doctrine, research, employment, organization, procedure, and plans of the German air force.” Among 
the personalities involved in the operation are some  who will become involved in UFO investigations in the 
future: Col. John A. O’Mara,  Col. Howard H. McCoy , Col. Harold E. Watson,  and Col. Malcolm D. Seashore .

Neal to a waiting aircraft and Brown takes off in pursuit of a ball of fire that quickly leaves him behind as it 
speeds off to the northwest and is lost to radar. On another occasion, naval officer R. W. Hendershot, flying an 
SNJ aircraft, is asked by ground radar to make contact with two high -altitude blips flying at the speed of a single -
engine Piper Cub. Though he can see nothing, he is convinced the blips are real. ( Strange Company  142; Nukes

1945, January  — Ray Palmer  edits, rewrites, and publishes Richard S. Shaver ’s description of the cave -dwelling Dero for 
the March 1945 issue of Amazing Stories  under the title “I Remember Lemuria.” The issue sells out and generates 
quite a response. Between 1945 and 1949, many letters arrive attesting to the truth of Shaver ’s claims (tens of 
thousands of letters, according to Palmer). The correspondents claim that they, too, have heard strange voices or 
encountered denizens of the  Hollow Earth . (Wikipedia, “ Richard Sharpe Shaver ”; Richard S. Shaver, “‘I

1945, February 1 0 — The Chicago  Tribune  and Washington  Times -Herald  reveal Bill Donovan ’s plans for a postwar 
intellige nce agency and publishes a secret memo he has sent to Roosevelt  proposing its creation. The article 
compares the proposed agency to the Gestapo. Knowing that Americans want a smaller federal government after 
the war, Roosevelt is not entirely sold on Donovan ’s proposal, although Donovan feels reasonably confident that 
he can talk the president into the idea. J. Edgar Hoover  disapproves of Donovan ’s plan, which he sees as a direct 
threat to FBI authority, even though Donovan has stressed that his agency will operate only abroad, not 
domestically. (Walter Trohan, “ Super -Spy Idea Denounced As New Deal OGPU, ” Chicago Tribune, February 10,

1945, March — A man is squirrel hunting in a wooded area near Belfast, Maine, when he sees a huge, elongated object 
just above the trees.  He runs after it, thinking it is a dirigible about to crash. The object crashes into the trees at the 
far edge of a clearing, splitting a huge pine tree down the middle. He smells burned rubber. The object seems to 
be as big as several B -36 bombers . As he stands there stunned, the lowest end of the craft begins to rise and he 
hears a humming sound of increasing intensity.  After it rises to a horizontal position, it begins to spin faster and 
faster and the hum becomes very intense. Suddenly one end spews a shower of fine, silvery threads that glint in 
the sunlight. The object begins to change to a white metallic color and it takes off straight up at fantastic speed.

 1945, April — During operations around Okinawa , Japan, the radar crew on the aircraft carrier USS Independence  
frequently notice s strange radar returns that move at slow speeds (30 –70 mph). Aircraft and destroyers sent to 
search for them never find anything. These radar ghosts are usually detected 25 –30 miles away at an altitude of 
1,500 feet, but occasionally 3,500 feet. The primar y diagnostic for these false returns is their speed. The Navy 
nicknames them the “ghost of Nansei -shoto” after the Japanese name for the Ryukyu Islands, of which Okinawa 
is one. ( Strange Company  183–186) 
1945, April — Ray Palmer  publishes a second story by Richard Shaver , “Thought Records of Lemuria,” in the June issue

“tight formation of more than fifty birds.” ( Strange Company  184) 
1945, April 24 — The USS Audubon  is headed for Okinawa , Japan,  with US Army passengers and equipment. Radar 
operators pick up “unidentified aeroplanes” heading their way. The screens show a blip, alternately fuzzy and 
strong, some 8 miles away headed down the starboard side at 25 mph . Still, nothing can be seen visually, and the 
radar operator suggests that it is a flock of birds.  (Strange Company  184–186)

California, when she sees out of the left-hand window a bright, stationary, yellowish -white light in the 
northeastern sky. It looks like Venus but has a yellow color. She gets off the bus and still watches it, walking 
home. Soon she sees it is moving slowly  to the northwest. She gets her mother to view it as well. Druffel thinks it 
is too high to be a coastal defense balloon.  Druffel watches it for 90 minutes, afte r which it takes on some 
“activity.”  Some 10 –15 pieces of light begin separating from it , fading from view after moving several diam eters 
away from the large object.  (Ann Druffel , “UFO Sightings by UFO Researchers: The ‘Inaccessible Cases, ’ Part
