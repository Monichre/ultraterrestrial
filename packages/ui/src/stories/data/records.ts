Lazar asserts that he worked on alien spacecraft and that the propulsion systems of these vehicles were powered by Element 115 (Moscovium), which was not synthesized by humans until 2003. He also claimed to have read government documents detailing alien involvement in human affairs over the past 10,000 years.

        'Moscovium, formerly known as ununpentium with the symbol Mc and atomic number 115, is a synthetic element that was first synthesized in 2003 by a joint team of Russian and American scientists at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, Russia. In December 2015 it was recognized as one of four new elements by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) and the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP), and was officially named moscovium in November 2016 after the Moscow Oblast, where JINR is located. Moscovium is extremely radioactive. its most stable known isotope, moscovium-290, has a half-life of only 0.65 seconds. The element gained a significant amount of attention in the realm of UFO conspiracy theories and science fiction due to claims by Bob Lazar, who in the late 1980s claimed to have worked at a secret site called S-4 (near Area 51). Lazar alleged that he worked on reverse-engineering extraterrestrial technology and that moscovium was used as fuel for the propulsion of alien spacecraft, due to its purported ability to produce anti-gravity effects when bombarded with protons. However, these claims are not supported by any scientific evidence and are considered to be part of UFO mythology and lore.',

Once it finds a suitable destination, it lands and mines the material it needs to build even more devices, which, in turn, land on other planets and moons and build even more.\n\nThe system is very effective, and by some estimates, it would take around half a million years to dispatch millions of probes across our galaxy, assuming each one travels at approximately 1/10th the speed of light, or 18,640 miles (30,000 km) per second (though the real number could be closer to ten million years, which is still no time at all in the grand scheme of things).',

        'Joint elements of ONI, NSA, DHS, and SAP cleared experts curated by the DoD have conducted careful examinations of aggregated data and witness accounts[1]. The scope of the referenced in this subsection refers to CERT class cases, which are in turn designated as such due to a common similarity in behavior with other high-credibility cases. As mentioned in section III, this class contains 1,292 cases and is the only class capable of receiving post-analysis treatment[2].\n\nBehavioral Conclusions:\n\nData from Secondary Reference reports indicate a significant commonality in stimulus-response and lead to generalized conclusions of the nature of UA/SP cognitive processing[3][4]. Although the details differ, this body is reasonably confident that expert findings indicate some form of inorganic intelligence.\n\nAll cases where UA/SP contacts performed a reactionary behavior that was not immediate disengagement can be broadly described as displaying a sense of fear and curiosity. Some data-backed witness accounts went so far as to describe the interactions as “playful… like a puppy[5]” and “skittish but very aware, sort of like a parrot, actually.” This behavior is a primary indicator of CERT class cases and is not seen in cases that have been otherwise explained. The report[6] employed a blind study using known behavioral data processed through a customized AI, essentially reverse-engineering the thought processing using gathered stimulus/response data. A DoD computing cluster ran a virtual neural network using the engineered processing system and found that UA/SP behaviors can be reproduced with 98.4% certainty in a closed processing environment. The report concluded that the behaviors analyzed from such contacts exhibit AGI Strong and ASI Weak behaviors and can be reproduced with current computational systems. This report is significant as it indicates that extraneous processes found in organic life are not impacting behaviors. The elimination of these variables and the effect of maneuvers seen in Section II on chemical processes suggest that UA/SP contacts are either remote, autonomous drones or a form of mechanical life.\n\nThe Harmen-McCarren[3] report uses the “1999 Discrepancy” to suggest an update may have changed the behavior and physical construction of UA/SPs, thus classifying them as drones deployed by an organic species. Shibakoya [4] responds to this claim, countering that a machine intelligence may react similarly to a particular stimulus and hypothesized that the rapid increase of flight performance might indicate a stepped virtual evolution process. Likewise, Shibakoya extrapolates that the gradual shift in appearance and behavior of detected CERT cases may be an artifact of generational changes, with older models beings relegated to less involved tasks. The Harmen-McCarren and Shibakoya reports both propose that a potential…',

It\'s just a glitch, right?"\n\nVentusky tried to ward off the conspiracy theorists in a post on X.\n\n"A significant number of people still do not believe that the giant waves off Africa were just an error and prefer UFO theories," the company wrote.\n\n"What can we do as a visualization platform? Add more sources!" the company said.',

        'On May 1, 2023, a family in Las Vegas reported a highly unusual incident involving the crash of what they believed to be a UFO in their backyard. This event was accompanied by sightings of extraterrestrial beings, which they described in detail during their emergency calls and subsequent interactions with the police.\n\nDetails of the Incident\n\n\nLate in the evening on April 30, leading into the early hours of May 1, the family experienced something extraordinary. They reported seeing a bright object falling from the sky, accompanied by a significant impact that they felt physically. The family, including a man, his father, and his brother, were in their backyard at the time, working on a truck when this incident occurred.\n\nTestimonies and Descriptions of the Beings\n\n\nThe primary witness, during a 911 call, described the beings as very large, estimating their height to be between eight to ten feet. He emphasized repeatedly that these beings were "not human." The beings were described as having big, shiny eyes and a non-human appearance, which left the witnesses terrified. This description was consistent across various accounts provided by the family.\n\nPolice and Investigative Response\n\n\nThe Las Vegas Metropolitan Police responded to the scene and conducted an investigation. Officers on site and their bodycam footage captured part of the event, although some details were obscured due to privacy concerns. The police were initially skeptical but decided to investigate further after multiple reports aligned with the family\'s account. Despite the investigation, the exact nature of what crashed and the beings observed remains unclear, with official sources suggesting various possibilities, including rare atmospheric phenomena.\n\nPublic and Media Reaction\n\n\nThe incident attracted significant media attention, with various news outlets and social media platforms featuring the story. The family\'s testimony was supported by other independent reports of a bright streak across the sky that night, adding credibility to their claims. However, there was also skepticism, particularly regarding a video that surfaced later, which was suspected to be manipulated due to inconsistencies in the recording date and the actual event.\n\nConclusion\n\n\nThe Las Vegas UFO and alien sighting remains a topic of intrigue and speculation. The combination of physical evidence, multiple witness testimonies, and the intense reaction from both the public and authorities highlights the continuing fascination with and fear of the unknown, particularly regarding extraterrestrial life and unidentified flying objects.',

        'Early 2015, several incidents involving UAP were reportedly observed by U.S. Navy personnel with the USS Theodore Roosevelt carrier strike group. Some of these UAP encounters were observed both visually and on radar, and in two instances produced footage of objects the Department of Defense later authorized for release and characterized as “unidentified.” The UAP sightings, initially reported by The New York Times in May 2019, were said to have occurred “almost daily” for periods between the summer of 2014 and the Theodore Roosevelt’s deployment in March of the following year. \nAlthough the appearance of the UAP varied between accounts, most of the objects were described by Navy personnel as small and lacking features. One description of the objects likened the UAP to “a spinning top moving against the wind.” In another incident involving pilots who reported a near midair collision as one of the objects flew between them, the UAP was said to resemble “a sphere encasing a cube.” According to the Times, Navy pilots who observed these objects said that no engines or power sources were visible on the UAP, and that exhaust plumes or other evidence of propulsion also remained absent when observing the UAP through infrared imaging systems.\nAccording to former Navy lieutenant and F/A-18F pilot Ryan Graves, the objects sometimes resembled “gauzy blobs” when viewed through cockpit displays. The UAP sightings reportedly occurred so frequently between late 2014 and early 2015 that pilots began calling them “those damn things” when they appeared.⁷ Graves told the Times that the objects “would be out there all day,” and were reportedly observed remaining in the air for periods of as much as 12 hours. \nAlong with Lieutenant Graves, the objects were also observed by Lieutenant Danny Accoin and others in Strike Fighter Squadron 11 (VFA-11), the “Red Rippers”, a United States Navy strike fighter squadron out of Naval Air Station Oceana, Virginia. Three pilots with the squadron who spoke with the Times in 2019 declined to be named. The UAP incidents reportedly “tapered off” once Theodore Roosevelt was deployed for its mission in the Persian Gulf in March 2015. However, Graves later clarified that he “did occasionally see radar signatures that performed in ways that were consistent with our experiences back home, though at a significantly reduced rate.”',

        'At around 9.20 pm on April 25, 2013 an object of unknown origin approached from the Atlantic Ocean (from the north) before traveling directly over the Rafael Hernandez Airport runway in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico, delaying the departure of a commercial aircraft. The UAP then re-crossed the airport’s runway on its way out to sea, again heading north.\nThere was no squawking transponder signal to alert the airport tower, nor was there any communication with the tower to prevent danger to arriving and departing aircraft from the airport. The pilot of an airborne U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) aircraft claimed to have seen a pinkish to reddish light over the ocean, northwest of the airport, through his left window. According to the pilot, the light was moving towards the airport and he believed it to be higher than his own aircraft, which was around 1600 to 2100 feet.\nThe pilot confirmed visual contact with tower personnel, who also confirmed visual contact. As the object approached the shore, its light “went out.” At that moment, the pilot requested monitoring of the craft with the on-board surveillance equipment. The aircraft’s on-board radar equipment did not detect the object, according to the pilot, but its thermal imaging equipment (FLIR) did. Whilst being seen through the thermal imaging equipment, the pilot did not have visual contact with the UAP. The pilot also confirmed that no attempt was made to intercept the UAP, nor did the object seem to react to the CBP aircraft.\nAnother witness, whose identity is not known, claimed that the UAP caused the delay of commercial aircraft from the airport. This witness also said that the thermal infrared video showing the UAP was widespread within a CBP office. Furthermore, the witness said that United States Air Force (USAF) Intelligence was contacted and provided with a copy of the video. USAF Intelligence, according to the witness, offered no explanation for the UAP and recommended other agencies to contact, whose identities are not known. In the 3 minute 54 second FLIR video, a small object can be seen moving above the ocean and land. Although filmed at night, the object appears to maneuver through residential areas and trees and enters the Atlantic Ocean (without slowing down) before splitting into two separate objects.\nAn investigation by the Scientific Coalition for UAP Studies (SCU) concluded the UAP to be of unknown origin, adding that ‘there is no explanation for an object capable of traveling under water at over 90 mph with minimal impact as it enters the water, through the air at 120 mph at low altitude through a residential area without navigational lights, and finally to be capable of splitting into two separate objects.',

        'On the evening of January 8, 2008, several residents of Stephenville, Texas, reported seeing unusual lights moving quickly through the skies. At approximately 6:15 p.m. witnesses Steve Allen, Mike Odom, and Lance Jones observed a series of flashing lights that they judged to have been at or close to “3,500 feet above ground level,” spanning a region of the sky they estimated to be approximately one square mile. No sounds accompanied these lights, which they said appeared “directly above Highway 67 traveling towards Stephenville at a high rate of speed.”\nAccording to Allen, a private pilot at the time with three decades of flight experience, the lights were traveling at an estimated 3000 miles per hour. He did not recognize them as being similar to any kind of standard lighting associated with aircraft, but instead were “more like strobe lights,” which at one point changed their orientation from a single horizontal line into a pair of vertical rows of lights roughly one-quarter mile apart. Allen said the lights, which were white in color, began to resemble “dirty burning flames” before abruptly disappearing.\nTen minutes later, the lights appeared again, this time with what appeared to be a pair of fighter jets in pursuit. A consistent feature of the January 8 observations had been the silent passage of the lights overhead at what appeared to be tremendous speed. According to Odom, the lights he and the other two men observed were “something not natural; it was moving way too fast.”\nAllen, Odom, and Jones were among the first observers to receive widespread attention for their sighting, following the publication of an article by reporter Angelia Joiner that appeared in the Stephenville Empire-Tribune two days after the incident on January 10, 2008.\nBy the following week, the story had begun to receive national attention from outlets that included the Associated Press. A CNN article published that Monday, January 14, 2008, reported that witnesses now numbering several dozen, “including a pilot, county constable and business owners” had all seen the silent array of lights passing over Stephenville one week beforehand. Several of the witnesses also reported seeing the fighter jets in pursuit of the object, as first reported by witnesses Allen, Odom, and Jones.\nLee Roy Gaitan, a police officer in Stephenville had been walking to his car when he observed, “a red glow that reminded him of pictures he’d seen of an erupting volcano” attached to an object “suspended 3,000 feet in the air.” Gaitan, whose son also observed the hovering object, had been reluctant to come forward with his sighting until he, like other witnesses, read about the sightings in the Empire-Tribune.\nA Mutual UFO Network investigation yielded several conclusions. Among these had been that radar data seemed to corroborate several witness reports of one or more large, unknown objects seen over Stephenville on the evening of January 8. Additionally, some of the radar data obtained by MUFON appeared to indicate that one of these unknown objects had slowly traveled in the direction of Crawford Ranch, the Texas residence of President George W. Bush. The report also noted that there had not been a significant reaction from the military in response to the events, although there had been a number of military aircraft traffic in the area on the evening in question, which in some instances “strayed out of their standard Military Training Routes and into civilian airspace.”\n“It is very difficult to dismiss witness testimony that is corroborated by radar,” the authors wrote in the MUFON report, noting that “radar tracked one of those two objects for over an hour as it traveled directly toward Crawford Ranch. The authors cannot comment on the source or origin of this object, but it is clear to the authors that the unknown object was real and not imaginary.”',

        'On November 7, 2006, at least 12 United Airlines personnel and potentially hundreds of other witnesses noticed a dark gray metallic disk hovering above United Airlines Gate C17 at Chicago O’Hare airport. The object was estimated to be about 22 feet in diameter, and hovered approximately 1500 feet off the ground below a heavy cloud cover for at least 20 minutes before propelling upwards, punching a hole through the cloud. Some witnesses also said the object was spinning. Among the witnesses were managers, runway crew, and airline pilots. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) reported that no air traffic controllers saw the object and that it never showed up on radar, though subsequent FOIA requests revealed this may not have been true.\nThe significance of the case lies principally in its aftermath: media coverage of the event exploded across local, national, and international news, and the FAA came under scrutiny for initially denying the existence of any witness reports from airline personnel. When they were later forced to admit that reports did exist, they still refused to investigate them. The FAA’s response to the event is reflective of a forty-year legacy of U.S. government agencies shielding UFO activity and investigations from the public domain, and the stigma that witnesses may face when coming forward with testimony.\n NARCAP, an independent UFO investigation group, also conducted their own research into the O’Hare incident. A team of NASA scientists, pilots, meteorologists, and aerospace engineers spent 5 months preparing a 154 page report confirming the presence of a physical object over O’Hare. The report, co-authored by NARCAP’s founder Dr. Richard Haines, concluded that the object’s maneuvers could not be explained by conventional means, and advised the FAA to launch their own investigation.',

        'During a routine training mission with the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz off the southern California coast on November 14th, 2004, U.S. Navy Lieutenant Commander Alex Dietrich and her then-commanding officer, David Fravor, received a request from another warship to interrupt their routine training mission to investigate strangely moving radar contacts in the area.\n“We’ve been tracking these things for two weeks...this is the first time we’ve had planes airborne and we want you to go see what these are,” Fravor remembers the U.S.S. Princeton officer telling him.\nWhen the pilots reached the assigned location, they spotted a disturbance under the water that Fravor thought looked something like the size of a Boeing 737 airplane. Dietrich and Fravor then saw what they described as a smooth, white oblong object resembling a Tic Tac flying at high speed across the water—Dietrich estimated that it was skimming 500 to 1,000 feet above the water at around 500 knots (575 mph).\nDietrich’s F/A-18 Super Hornet’s onboard radar couldn’t detect the object, but her weapons systems operator (WSO), who has remained anonymous, was sitting in the rear seat and saw it too.\nDietrich recalled. Speculating about what it could be, she said, “we don’t know what it was, but it could have been a natural phenomenon in human activity. But the point was that it was weird, and we couldn’t recognize it.” In a CBS 60 Minutes interview, she noted how it had no “predictable movement and no predictable trajectory.”\nFravor described it as a “ping pong ball...very random.” Fravor turned to “engage” with the object, which responded in a way that “lacked any visible flight control surfaces or means of propulsion,”\nIt then turned abruptly and “started mirroring” Fravor’s aircraft as he began a slow circular descent toward it. \nHe then made the decision to cut across and head directly toward the object, at which point it disappeared. The underwater object had also disappeared. The fighters conferred with the Princeton and were told to head to a rendezvous point about 60 miles away, where the object had appeared again. However, when they arrived, it had disappeared once more.\nAn hour after Fravor’s group of pilots witnessed the object, Lieutenant Commander Chad Underwood managed to capture the object on video.',

        'Around 10 o’clock on the morning of September 16th, 1994, 62 Ariel School students between the ages of 5 and 12 years old reported that a flying object had landed on the school’s grounds. The teachers were in a meeting, so the children were essentially unsupervised during their morning break in the schoolyard. The only available adult was one of the students’ mothers, who was operating the school “tuck shop–a sort of snack bar where candy, snacks and soda are sold.” The children said that they first saw three objects, which would “disappear and reappear in a different location.” The objects gradually approached the ground and eventually landed in a “brushy area” that was about 100 meters from the schoolyard and off-limits to the students. The children said that a small man, about one meter in height, appeared on top of the object and walked across the ground toward the students until he noticed them. Then, he “vanished and reappeared on top of the object,” which then took off and disappeared. The younger children were very frightened and called for help, because they believed the little man was a demon who would eat them. They ran to the tuck shop operator, Mrs. Alyson Kirkman, a physiotherapist that was volunteering at the school, but she did not want to leave the shop unattended and so did not go with them. According to an interview with documentary filmmaker Randall Nickerson, who is directing a documentary on the subject, “the children were not initially believed by the teachers or the headmaster, but after they had gone home to their parents and shared the story with their parents, the headmaster had them come back and draw what they saw. There were 60 drawings made.”',

The pilots attempted nine intercepts but said the objects appeared and disappeared and maneuvered at speeds beyond any known capability, dropping from 10,000 to 500 feet in 5 seconds.

        'UAP sightings were reported by hundreds of people in upstate New York and Connecticut between 1983 and 1986. Nicknamed the "Westchester Boomerang,” the UAP was described by most witnesses as a huge, hovering V-shaped series of flashing lights connected by a dark craft.\nOn March 24, 1983, a retired police officer observed a group of strange red, green, and white lights forming a V-shape off to the south, which at first he thought was an aircraft in trouble. The UAP moved slowly and a humming sound could be heard in the distance.\nEd Burns, a computer engineer at IBM, was driving home on the Taconic Parkway and had a similar sighting. “I’m not into astronomy… but what I had witnessed that night was not from this planet,” Burns said.\nDennis Sant, a former local government employee, had his sighting in Brewster, New York on March 17, 1983. “It was a very large object. The structure of it was very dark gray, metallic, almost girder-type looking… The object seemed to be very silent. The lights were iridescent, bright, they stood out in the sky and three-dimension. It looked like a city of lights. It just hung in the sky, all brilliant colors… We followed the object around to the backyard. And at that point, a feeling of fright came upon me. Thoughts started to flood my mind, thoughts of the craft touching ground, thoughts of an encounter with an alien being. Thoughts of being abducted. All types of fearful thoughts started to enter into my mind.”\nThese eyewitness testimonials were part of a group of sightings which allegedly continued in the Hudson Valley area for years after. On March 26, 1983, a front-page story in the Westchester-Rockland Daily Item ran the headline: HUNDREDS CLAIM TO HAVE SEEN UFO. The article got the attention of a group of UAP researchers in the area associated with Dr. J. Allen Hynek, a scientific consultant on UAP for the U.S. Air Force. The group started a hotline and received over 300 calls from people that had seen the UAP on the night of March 24. One witness cited in the book “Night Siege,” co-authored by Hynek, said “If there is such a thing as a flying city, this was a flying city." The object was seen in nearby Yorktown that evening where the police switchboard became jammed with reports all night long.\nAnother report Hynek’s group received was of a UAP the size of multiple football fields hovering over Indian Point Nuclear Plant. A guard at the power plant described it as being the length of three football fields. Another sighting took place at the Croton Falls Reservoir where allegedly the UAP used a red beam to scan the surface. The research group estimated that over 5,000 people had seen the object from 1982 through 1986 from the Hudson Valley and as far north as Brookfield, Connecticut. Some accounts noted the UAP moving at fast speeds and being able to disappear, and others speculated there could have been multiple crafts.\nThe mystery of the Hudson Valley remains unsolved.',

        'Early in the morning of December 26, 1980, U.S Air Force personnel stationed in Suffolk, England reported seeing unusual flashing colored lights descending on Rendlesham Forest, a wooded area near their base. Three airmen–John Burroughs, Jim Penniston, and Edward Cabansag–pursued the lights, while reporting by radio to nearby master sergeant, J.D. Chandler, and to their shift commander, Pat Buran. Penniston reported chasing a “mechanical object” with flashing lights. Burroughs saw movement in the trees but couldn’t discern the cause. Cabansag said they searched for more than an hour and concluded the lights they saw came from “beacon” on a nearby lighthouse. The following evening, December 28, 1980, responding to another report of unusual lights, Col. Charles Halt, deputy commander of the base, went to the scene of the incident with two officers, one of whom brought a Geiger counter to detect unusual radiation levels. As the men inspected the area, Halt dictated his observations onto a portable recording device.\n“We’re seeing strange lights in the sky,” Halt said, as the men tramped the woods. “We’re at the far side of the farmer’s...the second farmer’s field and made sightings again about 110 degrees. This looks like it’s clear off to the coast. It’s right on the horizon. Moves about a bit and flashes from time to time. Still steady or red in color.”³ Skeptics later noted that the Orfordness lighthouse was visible further to the east in the same line of sight.\nTwo weeks later, on January 13, 1981, Halt reported the incidents to the British Ministry of Defence (MoD) in a memo entitled “Unexplained Lights.”⁵ The three airmen who investigated, he stated in a one page memo, “reported seeing a strange glowing object in the forest. The object was described as being metallic in appearance and triangular in shape, approximately two to three meters across the base and approximately two meters high. “Illuminating the entire forest with a white light,” Halt went on, “the object itself had a pulsing red light on top and a bank(s) of blue lights underneath. …..As the patrolmen approached the object, it maneuvered through the trees and disappeared. At this time the animals on a nearby farm went into a frenzy.”\nHalt’s memo was based, in part, on a drawing that Burroughs made in his statement about the incident.\nThe next day “three depressions 1.5 inches deep and 7 inches in diameter were found where the object had been sighted on the ground,” Halt said. His Geiger counter, he said, recorded “beta/gamma readings of 0.1 milliroentgens … in the three depressions and near the center of the triangle formed by the depressions.” Nearby, trees had a “moderate” radiation level, he said. The significance of these findings is disputed by radiation detection experts.\nThat evening, when Halt and aides ventured out with the Geiger counter, he saw a red pulsing light on the horizon. Then “three star-like objects were noticed in the sky, two objects to the north and one to the south, all of which were about 10 degrees off the horizon. The objects moved rapidly in sharp, angular movements and displayed red, green and blue lights. The objects to the north appeared to be elliptical through an 8-12 power lens. They then turned to full circles. The objects to the north remained in the sky for an hour or more. The object to the south was visible for two or three hours and beamed down a stream of light from time to time.”\nAfter receiving Halt’s memo, the Ministry of Defence decided not to investigate further. “We believe that the fact that Col. Halt did not report these occurrences to MoD for almost two weeks after the event, together with the relatively low-key manner in which he handled the matter, are indicative of the degree of importance in defence terms which should be attached to the incident,” said a 1985 briefing paper for senior government officials, which was not made public until 2008.',

        'On December 21, 1978, at about 11:30 pm, Ian Uffindall, an officer in the Royal New Zealand Air Force, was patrolling an RNZAF base outside the town of Blenheim on the east coast of New Zealand’s southern island when he spotted from the tarmac a light in the sky that he initially took as an aircraft approaching to land. The apparent plane, however, never landed, and so Uffindall went to the base’s control tower and observed the light through binoculars. The light reversed direction and became three lights, which then executed geometric maneuvers while shining beams of light on the ground, Uffindall later recalled to documentarian Paul Davidson in the film The Kaikoura UFO’s.\nThe Blenheim base contacted air traffic control in Wellington, which is across the Cook Strait on the southern tip of New Zealand’s northern island.\nWellington air traffic controller John Cordry confirmed that the lights witnessed by Uffindall appeared as objects on Wellington radar and that the radar station had received multiple calls that night about the lights. Cordry contacted two Safe Air cargo planes that were airborne nearby and asked them to check out the area of the reported lights. (Safe Air, now called Airbus New Zealand LTD, is a freight airplane manufacturer and airline based in Blenheim that has long operated in close cooperation with the RNZAF.)\nOne of the planes, an Argosy ZK-SAE called Merchant Enterprise, headed towards the given coordinates where its captain and pilot, Vern Powell, and its first officer and co-pilot, Ian Pirie, soon observed a bright object emerge from the clouds on the Argosy’s port side.\nPirie later told Davidson the object was “so close it was almost frightening.” “It was the size of a house, burning in the sky,” Pirie said. “It was that sort of color and intensity … That’s what it looked like.” Powell and Pirie observed the light for several minutes, during which time the “target” remained on both Wellington radar and the Argosy’s radar.\nThe crew of the second Safe Air plane also observed strange lights just before 2am.\nThese airborne sightings, which occurred over the Kaikoura Mountains running along the northeastern coast of New Zealand’s southern island, matched numerous sightings from the ground. Several news stories on the sightings ran the following day on television, newspaper and radio. Channel 0 reporter Quentin Fogarty decided to retrace the flight path of the Merchant Enterprise. On December 30, 1978, at 11:46 pm, he took off from Wellington with freelance camera operator David Crockett, and David’s then-wife sound recordist Ngiare Crockett on board.\nA few minutes into the flight, just as Fogarty had just finished delivering an opening for the news story to camera, Startup allegedly called the Channel O crew to the cockpit. All onboard witnessed several lights that first appeared as “pulsating … pinpricks of light that would grow into great globes of light,” according to Fogarty. Reportedly, one light was stronger and apparently larger than the others. The smaller lights seemed to “dip away,” according to Ngaire, and then reappear closer to the larger light.\nDr. Bruce Maccabee, a Mutual UFO Network contributor and physicist specializing in optics at the U.S. Naval Surface Weapons Center, traveled to Australia and New Zealand to investigate the sighting and footage. Maccabbee concluded that the appearance of Venus and Jupiter neither matched the sequence of events, explained the shape of the lights throughout the footage captured by Crockett, were consistent with the way light “scatters” on film, nor explained the radar readings of objects tailing the Argosy at high speeds.\nAs for the size of the UAP captured on film, Maccabee analyzed frames depicting a “bell shaped” UAP at an estimated distance of 10 nautical miles. Accounting for the overexposure on the film, the effect of the camera’s 240 millimeter lens and the UAP’s brightness, which Maccabee estimated to be roughly equivalent to a 350,000 watt incandescent bulb, he estimated the size of the UAP to be about 100 feet wide.',

        "On September 18, 1976 in Tehran, Iran, at approximately 10:30 PM, Hossein Pirouzi, an experienced air traffic controller manning an Imperial Iranian Air Force (IIAF) command post at Mehrabad International Airport, was leading a training for a group of air controllers. Pirouzi received the first of four sightings reports: a call from a woman northeast of the airport who saw a luminous object glowing red, yellow, and orange. It was shaped like a four-blade fan, and seemed to split in two. A few minutes later, another caller reported a similar object in the same area of the sky, one which also split in two and then rejoined as one.\nThe tower radar was under repair, so Pirouzi could not confirm the UFO, but after receiving two more calls in the next half hour, he stepped outside to look through his binoculars: in the direction of the callers' sightings, he saw a luminous cylindrical object sitting horizontally in the sky about 1.8 kilometers, or 6000 feet, off the ground. He guessed that it was 8 meters wide, or just over 26 feet. Each end was glowing blue, and a red light was making an orbit around the center every second or two, and pausing every 90 degrees. The entire cylinder was rocking back and forth like a seesaw.\nAs it got closer, Pirouzi saw it slowly change into a drooping star-shape with a green body and a red glowing core. The arms of the star were dark orange, fading to yellow at the tips. It seemed to have four arms, though Pirouzi believed that there was actually only one arm, switching positions. When Pirouzi's trainees looked through the binoculars shortly after, they saw a semi-circle. The object seemed to be constantly changing shape.\nTwo F-4 Iranian Airforce jets were scrambled to investigate the UAP, lost instrumentation and communications as they approached it, and suffered temporary weapons systems failure while preparing to open fire. The UAP was seen both visually by the pilots and on radar.\nThe incident is recorded in a four page U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) paper which was distributed to the White House, Secretary of State, Joint Chiefs of Staff, NSA and CIA. It is one of the most well-documented military encounters with anomalous phenomena. The case is also exemplary for its mix of radar data, physical effects on military craft (such as the loss of weapons control), and multiple independent witnesses from different geographical locations and physical viewpoints (both airborne and from the ground). The case is also notable for the international collaboration of the investigations; U.S. intelligence agencies took over official documentation of the incident.",

        'Local newspapers and newscasts reported a fireball observed in\nthe skies over Kecksburg. According to some residents, they found\nan acorn-shaped object in the woods. The U.S. military closed off\nthe area to investigate and reported no evidence of a crash. A\nmodel built for Unsolved Mysteries is kept on display by the fire\ndepartment, which leads an annual UFO celebration. [110][111][112]At approximately 4:45 p.m. on the afternoon of December 9, 1965, several reports of a “fireball” streaking through the sky were reported by residents of several states including Pennsylvania, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, West Virginia, New York, and Canadian observers. Witnesses included weather observers and Canadian Coast Guard personnel. The sightings received additional corroboration from airplane pilots who described seeing a “flash of orange fire” in the sky coinciding with the reports, and witnesses in several states described seeing what they believed to be “falling debris” accompanying the fireball. Andrew Rosepiler, a resident of Midland, Pennsylvania, saw the object while driving, and “judged the object about the size of a football” with a long, trailing tail of fire and smoke. Another observer in the nearby township of Patterson claimed her son had observed, “a big ball of fire fall into the woods and the woods are smoking.” One pilot observer, Raymond Wallings of Ohio, was flying over Lake Erie when he observed a fireball that he watched until he believed it “plummeted into the lake.” Early speculations about what the object had been included a meteor, as well as the launch of a test rocket over Lake Erie, although Coast Guard and Air Force officials later confirmed that no rocket launch had occurred. ³ Several small grass fires were also reported in various parts of Ohio and Pennsylvania coinciding with sightings of the fireball.\nAccording to a Memo for the Record from the Project Blue Book case file for the Kecksburg incident dated December 10, 1965, a Major Howard from the Pentagon contacted the Air Force requesting information that could be given to the press about the fireball sighting the previous day. The memo states that Quintanilla “told him that a team of men were sent out from the Oakdale Radar Site in Oakdale, Pennsylvania,” who helped with the search near Kecksburg “until 2 o’clock, and were unsuccessful in finding the object.” The memo adds that detections of the object had been visual, and that it “was not picked up by radar,” and that the team of men who were sent out to pick up the object “worked along with the State Highway Patrol in trying to recover the object.” Quintanilla advised the Pentagon “to call it a meteor that entered the atmosphere,” though adding that the investigation was still ongoing, and that “There was no space debris which entered the atmosphere on 9 December 1965.” Similar memos issued on the same date further detail that a metallic substance located around the time of the fireball sighting was radar chaff foiling material recovered near La Pierre, Michigan.\nIn the decades after the incident, several individuals eventually came forward claiming to have observed an object in the wooded area where U.S. Air Force personnel and Pennsylvania State Highway Patrol workers conducted their search on the evening of December 9, 1965. Testimony from these individuals, collected by Pennsylvania investigator Stan Gordon, detailed observations of a “large metallic acorn-shaped object partially buried in the ground,” large enough for a man to stand within. The object was described as bronze or gold in color, and no rivets or seams were visible on its surfaces. Some individuals also said they observed unusual markings or “hieroglyphics” on portions of the object. Investigative reporter Leslie Kean, with help from the Washington law firm Lobel, Novins, and Lamont and others associated with the Sci Fi Channel, filed a lawsuit under the Freedom of Information Act to attempt to obtain records from NASA about the incident in a UFO advocacy initiative that became known as the Coalition for Freedom of Information (CFi). Two years later, in advance of the 40th anniversary of the Kecksburg incident, the space agency issued a statement saying that the incident had involved the reentry of a Russian satellite, but that two boxes of records pertaining to the incident “have been lost.” Dave Steitz, a NASA spokesperson, said that fragments from the object had been collected and studied by NASA scientists, but that records related to this had been misplaced sometime in the 1990s.',

        'On September 4, 1964, scientists allegedly caught a UAP on film during ICBM testing at Vandenberg Air Force Base. Dr. Robert Jacobs was in charge of the testing and had recently acquired a special telescope from Boston University owned by the U.S. Air Force to film the test launches. Many tests were failing, so the U.S. Air Force acquired a telescope to film the tests to determine the reason for the failures. Jacobs says the launch on September 4 went smoothly, and the giant BU telescope "swung over and got it, and we followed the thing."\nJacobs says they followed the missile through its launch stages until they heard their camera run out of film. He and his team did not witness anything unusual during the filming. The BU telescope was connected to a kinescope for recording, meaning they were not watching the test through that telescope.\n"We sent the film on down to Vandenberg," Jacobs explained, "and I don\'t know exactly how long it was after the event; it might have been a day or two, I was called into [USAF Major Florenz J.] Mansmann\'s office at the first strategic division\'s aerospace headquarters."\nJacobs says he entered the major\'s office where he saw Mansmann and two unnamed men in grey suits, something he later described as "very unusual." A film screen and a 16mm film projector were set up, and Mansmann asked Jacobs to sit on a couch. The major played the film, which depicted the launch that Jacobs and his team had filmed a day or two earlier, and he was struck at the high quality of the imagery produced by the BU telescope.\n"Into the fame came something else," recalled Jacobs. "It flew into the frame like this (motions with his hands), and it shot a beam of light at the warhead." Jacobs notes that the missile and the unknown object were flying at "several thousand miles an hour," a figure he later pegged at between 11,000 mph and 14,000 mph.\n"So this thing fires a beam of light at the warhead," he continues, "hits it, and then this thing flies up like this (demonstrates the object moving above the missile into its flight path), fires another beam of light, goes around like this (depicts the object moving to the other side of the missile), fires another beam of light, goes down like this (depicts object below and behind the missile), fires another beam of light, and then flies out the way it came in." At this point, the missile tumbled out of its flight path and fell to the ocean below.\nJacobs says at this point, Major Mansmann stopped the film, looked at him, and asked, "Were you guys screwing around up there?" Jacobs replied that his team had not altered the film in any way. Jacobs then says he recalls Mansmann asking him, "what was that?" He replied, "It looks to me like we got a UFO."\nJacobs says that after Major Mansmann showed him the film, he was told, "you are never to speak of this again. As far as you\'re concerned, this never happened." Jacobs says Mansmann reminded him of his security oaths and warned of the "dire consequences" Jacobs would face if he should share this information. Jacobs claims that as he was leaving, Mansmann suggested that "years from now if you\'re ever forced by someone to talk about this, you are to tell them it was laser strikes. Laser tracking strikes."\nJacobs says he is not aware of what happened with the film afterward. Mansmann later confirmed Jacobs\' story and said he also does not know where the film went.',

        "The Socorro UAP incident (also known as the Lonnie Zamora Incident) involves the sighting of a landed aerial vehicle of unknown origin and its occupants by policeman Lonnie Zamora near Socorro, New Mexico, on the afternoon of Friday, April 24, 1964. The incident is widely regarded as one of the best UAP close encounters ever documented and was logged among the many unidentified cases investigated by the United States Air Force’s Project Blue Book. A brief report on the incident was issued by the Air Force on June 8, 1964. Although stating that Project Blue Book’s investigation was still open at the time the report was issued, it presented several preliminary conclusions. Among these had been that there were no additional witnesses to the event and that no unidentified helicopters or other aircraft were determined to have been in the area at the time. There were also no instances where radar detections of unusual objects had been logged, nor any meteorological activity in the area at the time that might account for what Zamora observed. The report also stated that “no foreign material or radiation above normal for the surrounding area” was found from lab analysis of soil samples collected at the landing site, nor anything indicating a means of propulsion. “There was no evidence presented that the object was extraterrestrial in origin or represented a threat to the security of the United States,” the report added. Newspaper headline featuring Zamora alongside T/Sgt. David Moody (USAF/Project Blue Book).\nThe Air Force also made inquiries about the possibility that Zamora had witnessed part of a test involving a lunar landing module. “Fifteen letters were written to industrial companies asking them for their research status on lunar landing modules,” read the report, which added that such inquiries “had not been useful” in determining what Zamora saw, but that investigators believed “tenant organizations at Holloman hold key to sighting.”¹⁴ However, no conclusive evidence linking the incident to a test vehicle of any kind ever surfaced. Hector Quintanilla, director of Project Blue Book at the time of the incident, initially implied in a statement that the object had been some variety of experimental U.S. aircraft. However, in the absence of any evidence to support this assertion, the Socorro incident was later simply designated one of the many “Unidentified” cases in Project Blue Book’s investigations. Quintanilla, writing for the CIA journal Studies in Intelligence in 1966, went on to call Zamora’s observation “the best-documented case on record,” adding that “we have been unable, in spite of thorough investigation, to find the vehicle or other stimulus that scared Zamora to the point of panic.” In a 1975 memoir of his years with Project Blue Book, Quintanilla expressed dissatisfaction over the way UFO proponents interpreted the Socorro incident’s classification at the time. “Although I labeled the case ‘Unidentified’ I've never been satisfied with that classification,” Quintanilla wrote. “I've always felt that too many essential elements of the case were missing. These are the intangible elements which are impossible to check, so the solution to this case could very well be lying dormant in Lonnie Zamora's head.”\nTo date, no conclusive explanation for Zamora’s observation has ever surfaced.",

        'On the evening of August 5, 1953, several military and civilian witnesses reportedly observed what was described as “an unusual red object” seen moving over Rapid City, South Dakota. An initial call was received by the Air Defense Command radar station at Ellsworth Air Force Base from the local area Ground Observer Corps filter center shortly after dark, which detailed a sighting of the object from an observer near Black Hawk, South Dakota. According to the account, a woman approximately 10 miles west of the base had described seeing “an extremely bright light low on the horizon” visible to the northeast.\nThe object, according to one initial witness report, “would remain stationary, then hop up several degrees very quickly – almost instantaneously – stop, move to the left and then swerve down in sort of a slanting motion,” thereafter repeating this sequence of movements. Radar operators at Ellsworth had been engaged in a training operation involving an F-84 Thunderjet turbojet fighter flying west of the base at that time the base received the call. The object was observed for several minutes on radar by the warrant officer serving as the duty controller. He said it appeared to be moving slowly at an altitude of approximately 16,000 feet. As the duty controller watched the target moving on his scope toward the southwest, nearby base personnel were ordered to go outside and attempt to obtain a visual on the object. The observers soon reported back that they had spotted “a large bluish-white light” moving in the direction of Rapid City, following a wide circular path over the city before returning to its initial position when first detected on radar.\nFollowing the primary observations of the UAP over Rapid City, the warrant officer contacted the F-84 Thunderjet pilot, who was still on combat air patrol to the west of Ellsworth Air Force Base, advising him that he would be vectored toward the object in an attempted intercept. After a moment, the pilot communicated back to base that he could now see the light ahead in the distance. Closing to within three miles of the object, the UAP suddenly began to move away from the F-84, which the pilot, as well as the radar operator and visual observers back at Ellsworth Air Force Base, all observed simultaneously. Still at 16,000 feet, the UAP began to ascend and accelerate as it veered to the north with the F-84 in pursuit. As the pilot pursued the object, he communicated back to Ellsworth that the object appeared to suddenly brighten at intervals. Each time he would close to within approximately three miles, the craft would “automatically pick up speed and pull away,” as if the source of propulsion that moved the object were directly linked to a form of radar warning system aboard the UAP. The F-84 pilot continued to pursue the object for 120 miles on its northbound course away from Ellsworth, with it continually outpacing the fighter jet. Finally, running low on fuel, the pilot was forced to return to base.\nWithin minutes, a second F-84 was taking off in pursuit of the object, with the pilot quickly obtaining a visual of the UAP and closing toward it. The object began to ascend and moved in a northeasterly direction. As the pilot attempted to climb to the object’s altitude, it maneuvered below him, and resumed its characteristic accelerations each time the pilot approached within three miles of the craft. While pursuing the UAP, the second pilot attempted to discern whether the light could be a reflection caused by lights from his own aircraft, or possibly a celestial object. However, the object indeed appeared to be an airborne light, the source of which remained indiscernible from the pilot’s vantage. The pilot was also successful in detecting the object on his radar. When later interviewed by Project Blue Book Chief Edward Ruppelt, the pilot said that after pursuing the UAP for a period, he became frightened and requested that the controller allow him to abort the intercept. This time, the object did not follow the second pilot back to base and was last observed departing in the direction of Fargo, North Dakota.\nRuppelt said the radar controller had “left the impression he was trying to prove the existence of an unidentified flying object,” noting that the lack of photos depicting the object on the radar scope had been “unfortunate,” although adding that “he saw targets on the scope, there is no doubt about it, but whether they acted exactly as he stated is unknown.” Ruppelt’s general conclusion was that the incident, pending further study, remained unexplained.',

        'At 11:40 p.m. on Saturday, July 19, 1952, an air traffic controller at Washington National Airport spotted seven objects on his radar. The objects were located 15 miles (24 km) south-southwest of the city. No known aircraft were in the area, and the objects were not following any established flight paths. One of the senior traffic controllers later reported, "we knew immediately that a very strange situation existed." Other controllers claimed they saw a hovering "bright light" in the sky, which departed with incredible speed. Washington National Controllers called nearby Andrews Air Force base to find out if they saw the same thing. Although Andrews reported they had no unusual objects on radar, Airman William Brady, who was in the tower, reported seeing an "object which appeared to be like an orange ball of fire, trailing a tail . . . [it was] unlike anything I had ever seen before." Soon after, the pilot of a Capital Airlines passenger flight that had just departed Washington National was warned the tower detected several unknown objects were closing on his plane. The pilot claims he then observed six objects–which he described as "white, tailless, fast-moving lights" — over 14 minutes. "Each sighting coincided with a [radar] pip we could see near his plane," a controller said later. "When he reported that the light streaked off at a high speed, it disappeared from our scope." ⁶\nAt 3 a.m., shortly before two United States Air Force F-94 Starfire jet fighters from New Castle Air Force Base in Delaware arrived over Washington, all of the objects vanished from the radar at National Airport. However, when the jets ran low on fuel and left, the objects returned, convincing the senior air-traffic controller that "the UFOs were monitoring radio traffic and behaving accordingly." The objects were last detected by radar at 5:30 a.m.\nThe New York Times reported "Flying Objects Near Washington Spotted by Both Pilots and Radar " three days later. "The article cited an unnamed Air Force source who "received reports of an eerie visitation by unidentified aerial objects–perhaps a new type of "flying saucer"–over the vicinity of the nation\'s capital…".\nOn July 26, a second sighting occurred over Washington, and the Air Force scrambled F-94 intercept jets to give chase, but the objects vanished. Two days later, the Washington Post ran a front-page article titled, "\'Saucer\' Outran Jet, Pilot Reveals."\nAt a crowded Pentagon press conference on July 29, prompted by the intense public interest in the sightings due to the newspaper reports, Air Force Chief of Intelligence Major General John Samford said the "radar blips" might be due to an atmospheric condition known as "inversion." An inversion is a layer of cool air between layers of warm air, which can, under certain circumstances, reflect radar rays."\nWhen the chief of the U.S. Air Force\'s Project Blue UAP investigation, Capt. Edward J. Ruppelt, checked the data of the Air Defense Command Weather Forecast Center, he ruled out inversion as an explanation. "On each night that there was a sighting there was a temperature inversion," he later wrote. "but it was never strong enough to affect the radar the way inversions normally do." In addition, the second sighting was confirmed by some of his closest associates in the Project Blue Book, including a Navy electronics specialist assigned to the Air Force Directorate of Intelligence, who were in the airport control center. They "all saw the radar targets and heard the radio conversations as jets tried to intercept the UFO\'s," he said.',

        'On a day in late June or early July, 1947, W.W. “Mac” Brazel, a sheep and cattle rancher, and his eight-year-old son, Vernon, were minding sheep on their grazing lands near Corona, New Mexico, roughly 75 miles northwest of Roswell, when they discovered debris that appeared to consist of paper, rubber, wood and a lightweight metallic material.\nOn the morning of July 7, Brazel drove into Roswell for business. While in the city, he informed the local sheriff, George Wilcox, of the debris he had found. Wilcox placed a call to the Roswell Army Air Field (AAF). Major Jesse Marcel, an intelligence officer and member of the 509th Bomb Group of the US Army Air Force, and perhaps one other officer then accompanied Brazel to the debris site. Marcel left Brazel property with the debris in his vehicle and returned to Roswell Army Air Field.\nMarcel reported the recovery of the debris to the base commander, Colonel William Blanchard. The base’s duty press officer, First Lieutenant Walter Haut, then wrote up a press release⁷, describing the debris as the remains of a “flying object,” or “flying disc,” that “landed” on Brazel’s land. Blanchard approved the release.\nA local radio station, KSWS, was the first to announce the press release, and on the following day, July 8, the Roswell Daily Record printed a front page story under the headline “RAAF Captures Flying Saucer On Ranch in Roswell Region.” The Roswell Daily Record story could provide no no detail on the “saucer,” but implied a connection to a July 2 UAP sighting over Roswell by “Mr. and Mrs. Dan Wilmont.”\nAdditionally, an Associated Press version of the story, closely hewing to Haut’s press release, ran in The Chicago Daily News, The Rapid City Journal, the Sacramento Bee, the Los Angeles Herald Express, the San Francisco Examiner and other AP affiliated news outlets.\nWhile the “flying disc” headlines were hitting newsstands, Marcel boarded a Boeing B-29 from Roswell AAF with the debris, headed for Wright and Patterson Army Air Fields in Ohio¹⁰, home of Air Materiel Command, the Army Air Force’s intelligence division. However, the plane instead landed at the Army Air Field outside of Fort Worth, Texas, where Brigadier General Roger Ramey and Warrant Officer Irving Newton inspected the material.\nAccording to Ramey, the debris was the remains of a downed high-altitude weather balloon and a crushed “rawin target,” a device that measures wind velocity.\nRamey invited the press to view and take pictures of the debris and that evening he went on local radio to discuss his determination that the wreckage had an earthly origin.\nIn 1995 and 1997, after years of dismissing extraterrestrial claims, the U.S. Government through the U.S. Air Force responded with two investigative reports. Roswell was a coverup, the Air Force said, but the coverup of a Cold War spy balloon program. The stories of recovered bodies conflated aliens with parachute test dummies and actual soldiers injured and killed in a pair of aerial accidents, the Air Force said.\nBy some measure, the Air Force’s investigative reports were successful in settling the controversy around Roswell. For many, over time, some version of events offered by the U.S. Air Force supplanted the extraterrestrial hypothesis as a more likely explanation of the Roswell crash. In fact, some of the prominent UAP researchers who had advanced the narrative of bodies, wreckage and conspiracy have since recanted or substantially downgraded their claims. For the public, however, Roswell remains synonymous with aliens and conspiracy.',

      bio: "David Grusch is a decorated combat veteran and former intelligence officer for the USAF, who has come into the spotlight for his allegations regarding the U.S. government's involvement in UFO retrieval programs. According to Grusch, the government possesses spacecraft of non-human origin and has been involved in reverse-engineering these crafts as well as handling extraterrestrial biological materials. His claims include encounters with dead pilots within these unidentified crafts, suggesting a far more extensive government knowledge and interaction with extraterrestrial technology than previously disclosed【31†source】【33†source】.\n\nGrusch's military career is notable for his service in Afghanistan, where he provided crucial intelligence on high-ranking Taliban officials, significantly aiding U.S. and NATO forces. Post-military, he played a significant role in the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and the National Reconnaissance Office, focusing on UAP/UFO sightings and incidents【32†source】.\n\nDespite the explosive nature of his disclosures, the U.S. government, including the Pentagon and NASA, has denied finding any verifiable information to support Grusch's claims regarding the possession or reverse-engineering of extraterrestrial materials. The debate around Grusch's allegations underscores the ongoing controversy and fascination with UFOs and extraterrestrial life, highlighting the conflict between whistleblower testimonies and official government statement\nGrusch's story is a striking example of the complexities surrounding the issue of UAPs and government transparency, posing significant questions about the reality of extraterrestrial visitation and technology retrieval programs.",

Bigelow has been a long-time believer in UFOs and has provided significant financial support for investigations and research into UFOs and paranormal/parapsychological topics. \nIn the mid-1990s, Bigelow founded the National Institute for Discovery Science (NIDS), an organization dedicated to studying unexplained phenomena, including UFOs. NIDS operated until 2004. \nIn 1996, Bigelow purchased the Skinwalker Ranch in Utah, which had a reputation as a "paranormal hotspot". NIDS conducted research and investigations at the ranch for several years. \nIn 2007, Bigelow\'s company Bigelow Aerospace received a $22 million contract from the U.S. Department of Defense to study advanced aerospace threats, including UFOs. This was part of a secret Pentagon program called the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program. \nBigelow also collaborated with the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON) for a period, providing funding so they could investigate UFO reports more quickly and thoroughly. \nMore recently, Bigelow has shifted some of his focus towards researching the possibility of life after death. In 2021, his institute offered a $1 million prize for essays arguing for the existence of consciousness after death. \nBigelow has stated that he believes UFOs are real and that they could be present among the human population in some form, whether as extraterrestrial visitors or hybrids. He has said he is more interested in the "presence" of UFOs than just the "hardware" aspects. ',

      bio: "Tom DeLonge is a former member of the band Blink-182 and co-founder of To The Stars Academy of Arts & Science, focusing on UFO research.\nThis, DeLonge explained, ties into his belief that the U.S. government has exercised caution in revealing information about UFOs over the decades as a means to protect the public.\n\n\"I think in the beginning, it was probably a lot of fear,\" he said of the government's purported silence. \"You're dealing with World War II barely [being] over... We started having crashes. We had fighting through the war, but things started crashing and they're finding vehicles and they're finding occupants, and they don't know what it is. They're like, 'Where are these coming from?'\n\n\"They probably thought it was one particular thing. And then they start you digging into people's encounters and people are having contact and then not all the stories are good and people are getting hurt, and things are changing.\n\nGoldie Hawn reveals alien encounter: \"They touched my face\"READ MOREGoldie Hawn reveals alien encounter: \"They touched my face\"\n\"And they're looking into our mind and into our DNA, and then finding out over time, maybe these things aren't coming from other planets, these crafts seem to be doing things in the air, that has to do with frequency. And then there's understanding, you know, the universe, the world around us over decades, and we go, 'Oh, my God, these things might be coming through time.'\n\n\"It's just like, every time we find something out, it's so much bigger and more complex, and potentially damaging to us in various ways.\"\n\nWhile DeLonge's statements could be dismissed as wild musings, he was somewhat vindicated back in July, after claims were espoused in a special hearing that alien life not only exists but has traveled to Earth, with specimens held by the U.S. government. Research by his To The Stars Academy was also cited.\n\nIn a session of the House Oversight Committee, part of an investigation of claims regarding UFOs, witnesses testified that the government had been aware of non-human activity since the 1930s.\n\n\"The UFO Hearings today made history,\" DeLonge wrote in an Instagram post at the time. \"I am so proud of the three witnesses today that blew the lid off the UFO secrecy that has been intact for decades.\"",

      summary:
        'On December 29, 1987, Lear posted a Statement to ParaNet, an early bulletin board system dedicated to the paranormal, claiming that the US government has close contacts with extraterrestrials and were secretly "promoting" films like E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial and Close Encounters of the Third Kind to influence the public to see extraterrestrials as "space brothers".[26] The document was revised on January 14, again in March, with a final revision dated August 25, 1988. The document describing a secret government committee, Majestic 12, making a treaty with Gray aliens, only to later realize they\'ve been deceived by the aliens.[27][28]\n\nThe Statement claims a UFO coverup has been underway for 40 years. Lear argues that "Germany may have recovered a flying saucer in 1939" and discusses the 1946 American military investigation into the Ghost rockets reported over Sweden. The Statement argues that many in the "original group" of insiders committed suicide, most notably James Forrestal. According to the narrative, Truman formed a group of twelve insiders, known as Majestic 12, to investigate the matter. The Statement lists three saucer crashes: one near Roswell. another near Aztec, New Mexico and a third near Laredo, Texas. According to the Statement, the US government covered a "total, thorough and sweeping cover-up to include the use of \'deadly force\'."\n\nThe Statement references the 1952 Washington, D.C., UFO incident and a 1964 meeting with aliens at Holloman Air Force Base. Lear\'s Statement includes government-sanctioned alien abductions, alien implants, and Alien-Human hybrids. The Statement asserts that "some of the nations missing children had been used for secretions and other parts required by the aliens". Lear described UFOs in connect with cattle mutilations and even claims that human mutilations have occurred. Lear talks about Dulce Base and an altercation between aliens and the US military that led to 66 human casualties.\n\nLear\'s statement influenced Thomas Allen LeVesque, pen name "Jason Bishop III", who later admitted to fabricating stories about Dulce Base.

There were many explanations of what that could be, other than another spacecraft from another country or another world - it was either the rocket we had separated from, or the 4 panels that moved away when we extracted the lander from the rocket and we were nose to nose with the two spacecraft. So in the close vicinity, moving away, were 4 panels. And I feel absolutely convinced that we were looking at the sun reflected off of one of these panels. Which one? I don't know.

        "In an interview with Liberation Times, retired Rear Admiral and former Acting Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Tim Gallaudet, underscored the potential threat of Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) to submariners. \n\nHe also called for greater involvement and action from the White House’s National Security Council in directing the Department of Defense (DoD) and Intelligence Community to provide greater transparency on the topic.\n\nFollowing the publication of his recent white paper addressing the undersea aspect of UAP for the Sol Foundation, Gallaudet conveyed his eagerness to participate in a U.S. government-led investigation into UAP occurring beneath the ocean, framed by his informed belief that some of the phenomena may represent a form of higher non-human intelligence. \n\nGallaudet told Liberation Times:\n\n“I want to look in the oceans for UAP and evidence of higher non-human intelligence because I know the area really well. I know all the collection systems out there and the universities and government agencies that do ocean exploration and research. \n\n“I want to pursue the study of UAP in the oceans to add to the overall body of knowledge. \n\n“Why just limit ourselves to looking up when we know if we look below we'll find that evidence too?”\n\nGallaudet, a distinguished veteran and esteemed oceanographer, has engaged in discussions with both retired and active submariners. They shared their first-hand experiences with what appeared to be exceptionally advanced submerged crafts detected through sophisticated military sensor systems.\n\nOne retired submariner was referred by Gallaudet to the DoD’s UAP office, known as the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO).\n\nIn the 1980s, while serving aboard a U.S. submarine in the North Atlantic, the retired submariner witnessed a perplexing scenario: sonar suggested the presence of a Russian torpedo closing in on the vessel, but it soon became apparent that the object had no clear explanation. \n\nGallaudet told Liberation Times:\n\n“The submariner was in the North Atlantic during a very significant storm, when you had 40-foot waves. The waves mix the water up and create a lot of noise, making it really hard for submarines to find each other. \n\n“He did not expect to see any submarine contacts because of the high sea state. But the submarine encountered an object that started closing in on it rapidly. \n\n“It was so fast that the signature had every indication that it was a Russian torpedo. The crew had trained for this scenario. But it didn't make any sense for Russian submarines to be in that area and to be able to detect their submarine because of the high noise and sea state.”\n\nDemonstrating the seriousness of the situation, Gallaudet explained how the submarine’s crew were forced to take emergency action:\n\n“They were surprised and ended up taking evasive manoeuvres. They dove deep near the crush depth of the submarine.”\n\nBut strangely, the object slowed down as it approached the submarine, to the astonishment of the crew. \n\nGallaudet explained:\n\n“The object slowed down as it approached and then went around the submarine to the stern and began slowly trailing it. \n\n“It trailed the submarine for a time and then rapidly moved out of the area.”\n\nAs a highly distinguished naval veteran who has extensive knowledge and experience of undersea phenomena and military systems, Gallaudet has struggled to find an explanation for the encounter:\n\n“It had no explanation”, Gallaudet asserted.\n\n“Our technology couldn't do that. The Russians didn't have this in the 1980s, nor do they now -  so it cannot be explained.”\n\nFollowing the retired submariner’s interview with the AARO, he was informed that they would look into the acoustic datasets, which are held by Johns Hopkins University. Since the interview took place, no further information or update has been provided by the Office.\n\n“I don't know what the status of that is.\n\n“I'm almost certain it's not resolved in the nature of the movement of the object that was detected on the sonar.”\n\nThe manner in which the DoD has handled such threats has led to frustration among numerous active and retired military and intelligence officials. \n\nMany of them have communicated with individuals who have held high-security clearances, who allege to have been involved in covert programs focused on the retrieval and analysis of craft and biological entities of advanced non-human intelligence.\n\nGallaudet maintains contact with highly credible first-hand whistleblowers who assert, through programs they have worked on, that advanced multiple species of non-human intelligence in various crafts have visited and continue to visit Earth.\n\nGallaudet told Liberation Times:\n\n“I do know from the people I trust, who have had access to some of these programs, that there are different types of non-human intelligence visiting us whose intentions we do not know.” \n\nBut for Gallaudet, an experienced oceanographer, the allegation of multiple species of higher intelligence visiting the Earth is of no surprise, given the diversity of life the planet alone can support:\n\n“I guess it’s what you'd expect when you think about the nature of life just on this planet. \n\n“So why wouldn’t it be different for species that are of higher intelligence than us? It’s not a real stretch when you consider the diversity of life on this planet.”\n\nGallaudet, shares the frustrations of many other military and intelligence insiders, following the gutting of extensive UAP transparency language, known as the ‘UAP Disclosure Act’ (UAPDA) proposed by Senators Chuck Schumer and Mike Rounds last year.\n\nGallaudet views the lack of understanding surrounding purportedly advanced non-human intelligence linked to certain UAP sightings as a significant threat. \n\nHe stresses the importance of transparency, research and official acknowledgement to effectively address this issue.\n\n“We still don't understand their intentions, which is worthy of serious research and discussion, instead of putting our heads in the sand.”\n\nGallaudet believes that the frustration surrounding the AARO's recent attempt, through its latest historical report, to dismiss allegations of advanced non-human intelligence visiting Earth, should be directed towards the White House and its National Security Council.",

McKinnon admits these words “can be interpreted in various ways,” but one thing is for sure: given the name, we know they’re not based on Earth.\nMcKinnon says there were maybe 25 rows on the excel spreadsheet with officers’ ranks and names, and that the ships had the prefix ‘USS’ just like American sea vessels.\nHe claims there is evidence of “material transfer between ships”, of which he says there are possibly eight to ten.',

        'McKinnon says he found a log that listed non-terrestrial officers. Titled "Non-Terrestrial Officers." It contained names and ranks of U.S. Air Force personnel who are not registered anywhere else. It also contained information about ship-to-ship transfers, but I\'ve never seen the names of these ships noted anywhere else. He doesn’t believe that these were aliens, but he believes this to be evidence that the U.S. military has a secret battalion in space. Some of these logs were ship to ship transfers, but he says he was usually smoking pot while he hacked, so that prevented him from remembering the names of the ships. He also said he found a high definition picture of a large cigar shaped object over the northern hemisphere. The most shocking find to McKinnon, the one he thought would be his ace in the hole negotiating with the US.. government, was what he found hacking into the systems of U.S. Space Command. McKinnon says he found a log that listed non-terrestrial officers. He doesn’t believe that these were aliens, but he believes this to be evidence that the U.S. military has a secret battalion in space. Some of these logs were ship to ship transfers, but he says he was usually smoking pot while he hacked, so that prevented him from remembering the names of the ships. McKinnon told the Gaurdian: “I was smoking a lot of dope at the time. Not good for the intellect.”\n\nThere are rumors that he has talked about the names of two of the ships he saw on the transfer logs, the names of the ships allegedly being the USSS LeMay and the USSS Hillenkoetter. Typically Navy ship names just have two S’, an acronym for United States Ship, however there are three S’ here, presumably standing for United States Space Ship. The names of the ships are also significant.\n\nGeneral Curtis LeMay (credit: USAF)\nGeneral Curtis LeMay (credit: USAF)\nGeneral Curtis LeMay was friends with retired Air Force Reserve Major General and former U.S. Senator from Arizona, Barry Goldwater. Goldwater believed there was a UFO cover-up deep within the government, and suspected that his friend LeMay knew about it. There were rumors that there was UFO evidence being held in a secret room at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base called the blue room. Goldwater told the media several times that when he asked LeMay about this room, LeMay got upset and told him, “Not only can’t you get into it but don’t you ever mention it to me again.” Open Minds magazine will have an article going more into depth on Goldwater in the second issue.\n\nThe second ship’s namesake, Admiral Roscoe Hillenkoetter, was the first director of the CIA, and was also a member of a UFO research organization, the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP). In 1960, the New York Times reported that Hillenkoetter had sent a letter to Congress that included this statement: “Behind the scenes, high-ranking Air Force officers are soberly concerned about UFOs. But through official secrecy and ridicule, many citizens are led to believe the unknown flying objects are nonsense.”\n\nAdmiral Hillenkoetter (credit: USN)\nAdmiral Hillenkoetter (credit: USN)\nAlthough Hillenkoetter fought for the end of UFO secrecy, he eventually stopped commenting on the matter. Conspiracists also find Hillenkoetter intriguing because his name appears in debunked alleged secret documents that were leaked to UFO researchers. They list Hillenkoetter as a member of the infamous Majestic 12 group, an organization rumored to have been made up of high ranking military officers and civilians that was supposedly created by President Truman to initially manage the UFO issue.\n\nHowever, the fact that McKinnon actually released names of these ships is also a just a rumor, thus far there are no sources for this claim.\n\nSo there we have it, the UFO picture that McKinnon saw and the ship rosters were all he had, and unfortunately for him, they were not enough to scare the government into going easy on him. Instead he has been fighting a long multi-year battle to keep from being extradited to the US, a fight that he is losing. So far every British court he has appealed to has denied his stay.\n\nThe US government is really throwing the book at him, alleging that he took down military computers making the U.S. vulnerable soon after 911. McKinnon denies those claims, and says that he was able to observe many hackers from around the world accessing the networks he was on at the same time he was on them. Many believe that McKinnon may just be a scapegoat.',
