Moscovium is extremely radioactive. its most stable known isotope, moscovium-290, has a half-life of only 0.65 seconds. The element gained a significant amount of attention in the realm of UFO conspiracy theories and science fiction due to claims by Bob Lazar, who in the late 1980s claimed to have worked at a secret site called S-4 (near Area 51). Lazar alleged that he worked on reverse-engineering extraterrestrial technology and that moscovium was used as fuel for the propulsion of alien spacecraft, due to its purported ability to produce anti-gravity effects when bombarded with protons. However, these claims are not supported by any scientific evidence and are considered to be part of UFO mythology and lore.","xata":{"createdAt":"2024-04-10 18:16:19.92283+00","updatedAt":"2024-04-11 00:41:22.33411+00","version":4}},{"id":"rec_cobdesq5ojbselbdqra0","name":"Reverse Engineering Alien Technology","photo":null,"summary":"Reverse engineering involves deducing the design and functionality of a device, system, or software without prior knowledge of its processes. This method, widely used in software engineering, mechanical engineering, and electronic engineering, serves various purposes, including understanding how a product works, repurposing obsolete technology, conducting security analysis, and learning from or competing with other designs. While the primary focus here is on technological aspects, the concept intriguingly applies to the notion of reverse engineering alien technology, an idea often explored in science fiction and speculative discussions. This involves studying extraterrestrial artifacts or systems to understand their advanced technology, potentially leading to significant breakthroughs in human technology.","xata":{"createdAt":"2024-04-10 18:16:19.92283+00","updatedAt":"2024-04-11 00:47:26.03796+00","version":4}},{"id":"rec_cor05u8oepqha1jsmgo0","name":"Von Neumann Probe","photo":{"enablePublicUrl":true,"mediaType":"image/webp","name":"Von-Neumann-Probe.webp","signedUrlTimeout":600,"size":25756,"storageKey":"na30d98dgd1rpfnnifc3lrd8d8","uploadKey":"cor05u8oepqha1jsmgog","uploadUrlTimeout":86400,"version":0},"summary":"Simply put, a Von Neumann probe is a self-replicating device that could, one day, be used to explore every facet of the Milky Way in a relatively small window of time.\n\nThe general idea is to build a device out of materials that are readily available and easily accessible out in space, like on rocky planets or small moons. Once it finds a suitable destination, it lands and mines the material it needs to build even more devices, which, in turn, land on other planets and moons and build even more.\n\nThe system is very effective, and by some estimates, it would take around half a million years to dispatch millions of probes across our galaxy, assuming each one travels at approximately 1/10th the speed of light, or 18,640 miles (30,000 km) per second (though the real number could be closer to ten million years, which is still no time at all in the grand scheme of things).","xata":{"createdAt":"2024-05-04 09:42:17.80396+00","updatedAt":"2024-05-04 09:42:17.80396+00","version":0}},{"id":"rec_cor0bpooepqha1jsmgpg","name":"Leaked DOD Paper: UAP/UFO As Forms of Mechanical Life","photo":{"enablePublicUrl":true,"mediaType":"image/webp","name":"repost-of-leaked-dod-paper-tictacs-form-of-mechanical-life-v0-55afkvt1unxc1.webp","signedUrlTimeout":600,"size":262906,"storageKey":"s9fgur4na103t3irheq54eomac","uploadKey":"cor0bpooepqha1jsmgq0","uploadUrlTimeout":86400,"version":0},"summary":"Joint elements of ONI, NSA, DHS, and SAP cleared experts curated by the DoD have conducted careful examinations of aggregated data and witness accounts[1]. The scope of the referenced in this subsection refers to CERT class cases, which are in turn designated as such due to a common similarity in behavior with other high-credibility cases. As mentioned in section III, this class contains 1,292 cases and is the only class capable of receiving post-analysis treatment[2].\n\nBehavioral Conclusions:\n\nData from Secondary Reference reports indicate a significant commonality in stimulus-response and lead to generalized conclusions of the nature of UA/SP cognitive processing[3][4]. Although the details differ, this body is reasonably confident that expert findings indicate some form of inorganic intelligence.\n\nAll cases where UA/SP contacts performed a reactionary behavior that was not immediate disengagement can be broadly described as displaying a sense of fear and curiosity. Some data-backed witness accounts went so far as to describe the interactions as “playful… like a puppy[5]” and “skittish but very aware, sort of like a parrot, actually.” This behavior is a primary indicator of CERT class cases and is not seen in cases that have been otherwise explained. The report[6] employed a blind study using known behavioral data processed through a customized AI, essentially reverse-engineering the thought processing using gathered stimulus/response data. A DoD computing cluster ran a virtual neural network using the engineered processing system and found that UA/SP behaviors can be reproduced with 98.4% certainty in a closed processing environment. The report concluded that the behaviors analyzed from such contacts exhibit AGI Strong and ASI Weak behaviors and can be reproduced with current computational systems. This report is significant as it indicates that extraneous processes found in organic life are not impacting behaviors. The elimination of these variables and the effect of maneuvers seen in Section II on chemical processes suggest that UA/SP contacts are either remote, autonomous drones or a form of mechanical life.\n\nThe Harmen-McCarren[3] report uses the “1999 Discrepancy” to suggest an update may have changed the behavior and physical construction of UA/SPs, thus classifying them as drones deployed by an organic species. Shibakoya [4] responds to this claim, countering that a machine intelligence may react similarly to a particular stimulus and hypothesized that the rapid increase of flight performance might indicate a stepped virtual evolution process. Likewise, Shibakoya extrapolates that the gradual shift in appearance and behavior of detected CERT cases may be an artifact of generational changes, with older models beings relegated to less involved tasks. The Harmen-McCarren and Shibakoya reports both propose that a potential…","xata":{"createdAt":"2024-05-04 09:54:47.77271+00","updatedAt":"2024-05-04 09:54:47.77271+00","version":0}},{"id":"rec_cp1qh7nvvv266bunkd0g","name":"Close Encounters Scale","photo":{"enablePublicUrl":true,"mediaType":"image/webp","name":"encounters.webp","signedUrlTimeout":600,"size":335010,"storageKey":"jc3f50bj6t6gf6m8malg655or8","uploadKey":"cp1qh7nvvv266bunkd10","uploadUrlTimeout":86400,"version":0},"summary":"In his 1972 book, The UFO Experience: A Scientific Enquiry, Professor J.
